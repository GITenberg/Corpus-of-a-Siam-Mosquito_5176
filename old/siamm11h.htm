It was an early Bangkok morning with a new day tripping over</pre><pre>the corpse of the earlier one the way dogs on the Bangkok sidewalks</pre><pre>were walked on. It was early in the relationship of the two passengers</pre><pre>and this nascent association contained the complex and awkward</pre><pre>ambiguity of not being clearly professional or personal and he and his</pre><pre>prostitute-model were tripping into each other. When she put her hand</pre><pre>on his leg he would stiffen and both his legs would slightly slant away</pre><pre>from her but when she removed her hand and kept it away from him for</pre><pre>some minutes he would put it back there closer than ever to his thighs.</pre><pre>Even he had to admit his actions made no sense given the fact that he</pre><pre>flaunted her, and others like her, wherever he went; but it was part of</pre><pre>the game of being desired. Although he wasn't even conscious that such</pre><pre>a game was being played, she was fully cognizant of these subliminal</pre><pre>calculative moves and how a woman was played.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She knew that she was</pre><pre>desiring him more as a consequence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She also knew that being desired</pre><pre>required adhering to the rules of withdrawing from the neediness of</pre><pre>wanting to be linked to a man and of transforming herself into the</pre><pre>metamorphoses of self-contained fantasies that he would desire.</pre><pre><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Despite Thai's reverence for royalty, the three of them went down</pre><pre>Ramkhamhaeng Road without even thinking about the king behind the name.</pre><pre>He, his whore, and perhaps the faceless one at the steering wheel as</pre><pre>well, thought of themselves as a unit albeit an insignificant one.</pre><pre>They had that sociable tendency to chat at each other to reduce the</pre><pre>drone of one's solitary and melancholic thoughts but it was less the</pre><pre>case with the pensive passenger, Nawin (formerly Jatupon) who,</pre><pre>Aristotelian and poised as a Garuda, was a surly contemplative despite</pre><pre>lordly debauchery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Through being whirled in vicissitudes he felt that</pre><pre>he could withstand anything fate had to offer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unlike the others, he</pre><pre>did not need to escape his thoughts as much as a bull from a corral.<span
style='color:red'><o:p></o:p></span></pre><pre>Instead, he befriended his morose tendencies.</pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Basking in the grandeur of his new stature, the back seat Nawin</pre><pre>was dwelling on himself continually in the concern that his fame,</pre><pre>isolated as it was, had not happened totally from the merit of his</pre><pre>work. He wondered how much the licentiousness of his life and the</pre><pre>salaciousness of the subject matter were the real color of what could</pre><pre>be marginal talents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He wondered if he should change his subject</pre><pre>matter proving himself as an artist even if it reduced the virility he</pre><pre>felt as a type of swarthy Thai sex symbol. How strange it was, he</pre><pre>thought to himself, that despite the fact that being dark was never an</pre><pre>attractive trait in Thailand where the lighter, Chinese skinned Thais</pre><pre>were thought to have more material success, sensuality, and beauty, he</pre><pre>who was not particularly handsome from being dark as a shoe's heel</pre><pre>should be sexy from his wanton disposition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Likewise, his thoughts</pre><pre>were dark in a land of frivolous irresponsibility. To Thai's the word</pre><pre>&quot;serious&quot; had a negative connotation and he was that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unless one was a</pre><pre>monk, being contemplative was a tacit violation of laws in the Land of</pre><pre>Smiles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He had become the rescuer of whores humanizing their sorry</pre><pre>plight. Their only sins were to be born poor and to be loyal enough to</pre><pre>not pull out of the loose fetters of family obligations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They</pre><pre>continued to remember shadowy figments of obscure rural relatives whom</pre><pre>they needed to feed. Still being a hero was burdening him with a</pre><pre>singular motif and he continually shot this thought through his</pre><pre>neurological circuitry until the taxi driver spoke, parting his</pre><pre>thoughts like Moses and the Red Sea or Buddha sabotaging a bit of the</pre><pre>recycle factory of the human soul.</pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>&quot;My son flew into Chaing Mai recently. I've been wondering about</pre><pre>airplanes ever since-just thinking about how things get off the ground.</pre><pre> Have you ever wondered that?&quot;</pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>&quot;Ka,&quot; meaning yes, the woman in the backseat croaked like a crow.</pre><pre>&quot;I'm trying not to question it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Wondering such things would make me</pre><pre>scared that they don't stay up in the sky,&quot; she laughed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Her name was</pre><pre>Jarunee but her nickname was Porn. &quot;This will be my first plane ride</pre><pre>soaring off with the birds.&quot;</pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>&quot;Thais don't often fly,&quot; he said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His idea was tinged with a</pre><pre>bitter undertone as if poverty turned one's bones to lead and he found</pre><pre>that his idea put him back in the solitude of his thoughts for only</pre><pre>silence ensued.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He decided to sound happier. &quot;You sound excited.&quot;</pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>&quot;It has been my dream.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She leaned her head against Nawin's</pre><pre>shoulder.</pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>&quot;Flew off to Chaing Mai. He lost his job during the financial</pre><pre>meltdown of 96.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>3000 baht.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That's what the family lived on each month</pre><pre>for a good many years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then she was pregnant and laid off from the</pre><pre>restaurant and they stayed with us for five or six months. Of course</pre><pre>they could have stayed longer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After all, they are family.&quot;</pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>&quot;Yes, of course. You sound like a good father. I'm sure it will</pre><pre>get better for everyone soon,&quot; responded Porn as she looked up at the</pre><pre>old face in the mirror hoping with softness to make the tenor of the</pre><pre>conversation gayer.</pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>&quot;Krap,&quot; he said meaning yes although he wasn't in agreement. &quot;No,</pre><pre>he continually got more depressed and then no matter how many job</pre><pre>interviews he went on, he came up empty handed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then she took their</pre><pre>children to her parents. He came up there a bit later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The in-laws had</pre><pre>him but didn't want him. He hadn't been trained at anything but working</pre><pre>in the factory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He didn't know how to plant rice or maybe he was too</pre><pre>depressed to learn.

In</pre><pre>small quantities all emotions aid judgment calls in social situations</pre><pre>but unfortunately they are produced and expended in bulk. Unlike other</pre><pre>emotions that are rampant, empathy and compassion tend to be quite</pre><pre>rare.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Could you elaborate on his nascent burgeoning of empathy for</pre><pre>them and the disingenuousness that prompted it?</pre><pre>--It was no different than their aunt who hustled a marriage out</pre><pre>of him years ago. Kindliness and loneliness, from what I can tell, have</pre><pre>always been his weakness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was a simple calculating maneuver on</pre><pre>Kazem's part, really. Kazem affected being uncomfortable and shy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He</pre><pre>waited until this uncle asked directly about his circumstances and then</pre><pre>he gave a modest biographical summary of their move to Bangkok after</pre><pre>selling their parents assets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was careful not to mention Kumpee,</pre><pre>the need for money, or any real description of how they were living.</pre><pre>The uncle's attempts at finding out information on those putrescent</pre><pre>issues were only marginally successful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a result, it seemed to the</pre><pre>senator that Kazem was earnest and unassuming.

I don't wish to really.</pre><pre>--Human studies and our intellectual copulation require more</pre><pre>information.

He reminisced about his mother whom this</pre><pre>high governing uncle had sympathy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The senator of course entertained</pre><pre>this sympathy because his wife (their mother's sister) had always</pre><pre>carped, disparaged, and vilified her for such a marriage to an</pre><pre>illiterate street person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The senator never forgot his sister-in-law's</pre><pre>birthday even after his divorce. To be specific, Kazem was seated</pre><pre>before the senator drinking coffee and eating doughnuts when he</pre><pre>ironically spoke of how he missed the scents of flowers his mother</pre><pre>would bring into the home or the smell of a freshly cleaned floor. It</pre><pre>belied the truth of this porcine creature whose domestic tendencies had</pre><pre>surrendered to male nastiness early into marriage and motherhood. The</pre><pre>sad lonely tone resonated with the senator.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It strummed the harp of</pre><pre>his heart.</pre><pre>--What are these three brothers doing at present?</pre><pre>--At present they are drinking beer and celebrating with some of the</pre><pre>money that the senator gave to them.</pre><pre>--Did the senator give money that quickly?</pre><pre>--No, he dismissed Kazem after tiring of him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He said that he needed</pre><pre>to return to his work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And then as the teenage boy was leaving a</pre><pre>servant told him to return the next day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was then that a sizable</pre><pre>amount of money, by the standards of regular Thai people, was given to</pre><pre>him.</pre><pre>--Suthep doesn't seem as happy as the other two.</pre><pre>--He is happy with the money and the beer but his happiness sinks down</pre><pre>with the dying fizz of the beer but it rejuvenates again with the fizz</pre><pre>of the next beer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His behavior can be attributed to a bit of</pre><pre>repugnance toward the two companions at his table and a bit of general</pre><pre>moodiness aggravated with alcohol consumption.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He really has been so</pre><pre>moody ever since becoming a teenager.
