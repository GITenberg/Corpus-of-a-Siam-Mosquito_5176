<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; They, with their driver, went down
Ramkamhaeng Road singularly in the scope of their thoughts but
conditioned into repudiating their aloneness. It was an early
Bangkok morning with a new day tripping over the corpse of the
earlier one the way dogs on the Bangkok sidewalks were walked on.
It was early in the relationship of the two passengers and this
nascent association contained the complex and awkward ambiguity of
not being clearly professional or personal and he and his
prostitute-model were tripping into each other. When she put her
hand on his leg he would stiffen and both his legs would slightly
slant away from her but when she removed her hand and kept it away
from him for some minutes he would put it back there closer than
ever to his thighs.&#160; Even he had to admit his actions made no
sense given the fact that he flaunted her, and others like her,
wherever he went; but it was part of the game of being desired.
Although he wasn&#8217;t even conscious that such a game was being
played, she was fully cognizant of these subliminal calculative
moves and how a woman was played.&#160; She knew that she was
desiring him more as a consequence.&#160; She also knew that being
desired required adhering to the rules of withdrawing from the
neediness of wanting to be linked to a man and of transforming
herself into the metamorphoses of self-contained fantasies that he
would desire.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Despite Thai&#8217;s reverence for
royalty, the three of them went down Ramkamhaeng Road without even
thinking about the king behind the name.&#160; He, his whore, and
perhaps the faceless one at the steering wheel as well, thought of
themselves as a unit albeit an insignificant one.&#160; They had
that sociable tendency to chat at each other to reduce the drone of
one&#8217;s solitary and melancholic thoughts but it was less the
case with the pensive passenger, Nawin (formerly Jatupon) who,
Aristotelian and poised as a Garuda, was a surly contemplative
despite lordly debauchery.&#160; Through being whirled in
vicissitudes he felt that he could withstand anything fate had to
offer.&#160; Unlike the others, he did not need to escape his
thoughts as much as a bull from a coral.&#160; Instead, he
befriended his morose tendencies.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Basking in the grandeur of his new
stature, the back seat Nawin was dwelling on himself continually in
the concern that his fame, isolated as it was, had not happened
totally from the merit of his work. He wondered how much the
licentiousness of his life and the salaciousness of the subject
matter were the real color of what could be marginal talents.&#160;
He wondered if he should change his subject matter proving himself
as an artist even if it reduced the virility he felt as a type of
swarthy Thai sex symbol. How strange it was, he thought to himself,
that despite the fact that being dark was never an attractive trait
in Thailand where the lighter, Chinese skinned Thais were thought
to have more material success, sensuality, and beauty, he who was
not particularly handsome from being dark as a shoe&#8217;s heel
should be sexy from his wanton disposition.&#160; Likewise, his
thoughts were dark in a land of frivolous irresponsibility. To
Thai&#8217;s the word &#8220;serious&#8221; had a negative
connotation and he was that.&#160; Unless one was a monk, being
contemplative was a tacit violation of laws in the Land of
Smiles.&#160; He had become the rescuer of whores humanizing their
sorry plight. Their only sins were to be born poor and to be loyal
enough to not pull out of the loose fetters of family
obligations.&#160; They continued to remember shadowy figments of
obscure rural relatives whom they needed to feed. Still being a
hero was burdening him with a singular motif and he continually
shot this thought through his neurological circuitry until the taxi
driver spoke, parting his thoughts like Moses and the Red Sea or
Buddha sabotaging a bit of the recycle factory of the human
soul.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;My son flew into Changmai
recently. I&#8217;ve been wondering about airplanes ever
since&#8212;just thinking about how things get off the
ground.&#160; Have you ever wondered that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Ka,&#8221; meaning yes, the
woman in the backseat croaked like a crow.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m
trying not to question it.&#160; Wondering such things would make
me scared that they don&#8217;t stay up in the sky,&#8221; she
laughed.&#160; Her name was Jarunee but her nickname was Porn.
&#8220;This will be my first plane ride soaring off with the
birds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Thais don&#8217;t often
fly,&#8221; he said.&#160; His idea was tinged with a bitter
undertone as if poverty turned one&#8217;s bones to lead and he
found that his idea put him back in the solitude of his thoughts
for only silence ensued.&#160; He decided to sound happier.
&#8220;You sound excited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;It has been my
dream.&#8221;&#160; She leaned her head against Nawin&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Flew off to Changmai. He lost
his job during the financial meltdown of 96.&#160; 3000 baht.&#160;
That's what the family lived on each month for a good many
years.&#160; Then she was pregnant and laid off from the restaurant
and they stayed with us for five or six months. Of course they
could have stayed longer.&#160; After all, they are
family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes, of course. You sound like a
good father. I&#8217;m sure it will get better for everyone
soon,&#8221; responded Porn as she looked up at the old face in the
mirror hoping with softness to make the tenor of the conversation
gayer.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Krap,&#8221; he said meaning yes
although he wasn&#8217;t in agreement. &#8220;No, he continually
got more depressed and then no matter how many job interviews he
went on, he came up empty handed.&#160; Then she took their
children to her parents. He came up there a bit later.&#160; The
in-laws had him but didn't want him. He hadn&#8217;t been trained
at anything but working in the factory.&#160; He didn&#8217;t know
how to plant rice or maybe he was too depressed to learn. It
wouldn&#8217;t seem there would be much to learn. You just put them
into the ground. Anyhow, he was walking around in a daze all that
time.&#160; That&#8217;s what she claimed they said about him. Soon
he returned with us but before we knew it off he went to
Chaingmai.&#160; I don't know why.&#160; I got a post card from
there.&#160; It didn't say much other than he had taken his first
flight. Can you imagine just buying a ticket, leaving, and not
saying a word."&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Ka, not really.&#160; I
can&#8217;t imagine anybody doing that&#8230;unless he just
didn&#8217;t want to worry you.&#160; Maybe he didn&#8217;t want to
worry you about if the idea was right or wrong
financially.&#160;&#160; I bet he has friends there and
they&#8217;ll help him to locate work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes, it is the best thing.
I&#8217;ve been going to the temple to give food to the monks and
blessings will follow. I&#8217;m sure of that. I&#8217;ve never
gone on a flight. Where are the two of you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;To Montreal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Where&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;To Canada.&#160; She smiled but
the word, favorable as it was, didn&#8217;t have the flavor of
Paris or cities in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;What will you do
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Nawin wondered what she would be doing
there.&#160; She had escorted him around galleries, parties, and
auditoriums where he gave speeches.&#160; Bangkok gossip columnists
had sometimes even mentioned her presence with him.&#160; What
would she be doing in Montreal while he attended post-graduate
classes?&#160; That was a fundamental question he had no answer
for. He had granted unto her a new profession where she didn't have
to spread her legs to anyone but him. He had rescued her from
stripping and whoring in a bar in Patpong but perhaps that would
not be enough.&#160; Nobody was content.&#160; Like any animal, a
human always yearned for more.&#160; They were trying to build up
on themselves so that they were free of all discomfort.&#160; A
woman was more that way than even a man based on his judgments and
to be left alone in an apartment in a foreign country would be one
major discomfort she would not tolerate. He began to miss his
wife:&#160; she didn&#8217;t need anything--not even sex with
him.&#160; She was free to love other things than him--higher
things and he was free to love higher things than her as well as
the lower things like Porn.&#160; It was for this reason that he
loved her but he didn&#8217;t desire her so much except as an
intellectual companion.&#160; This one he desired and that love
certainly had more thrust than the former one.&#160; At least it
appeared to be stronger.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160; The sky had tubes of light paint oozing out into
the darkness and the sky could not ascertain if it wanted a moon or
a sun in its presence. The ride was just beginning and yet it was
monotonous in the darkness and the light of the street lamps that
refracted glaringly.&#160; The three of them still remained as
little conscious of the moon or, dependent on the limitation of
their eyes, the corona of the moon, that they happened to glimpse
as accompanying them on their early morning departure as they were
of the monarch, Ramkamhang, that was the source of the road's name.
The taxi driver was near-sighted so to him, as most things at a
distance, the reality of it all was begotten as a blur.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The back-seated Nawin with the
cigarette fuming and the legs sprawled out and thumping to his
portable CD player and his model or whore with her hand again on
one of his legs had their thoughts parted once more in the kinetic
movements of linguistic moans.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "What airline will you be flying out
of?" asked the taxi driver. Following patriarchal social etiquette
he was addressing the man instead of the girlfriend despite not
liking the smoke.&#160; The man was more than a customer but a
member of the more affluent class and this by Thai, although not
Buddhist standards, was well revered.&#160; How swift one's
encroaching aloneness was purged and thwarted in the retreat
engineered by the batons and water cannons of one's linguistic
moans. The whore, whose self-image had been disparaged by the
unconventional positive endorsement of her activities by the wife,
was grateful to gain the parting of her thoughts from the driver's
voice.&#160; She was pleased to be once again hearing
anything--even the least little unenlightening fact-about their
trip.&#160; She smiled.&#160; After all, it was the land of
smiles.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Thai" mumbled Nawin&#8217;s voice from
the back seat.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Domestic or international?" asked the
taxi driver as if amnesia had wiped away a whole section of memory.
Porn released an alien chortle that made Nawin think that he was
sitting on the back seat with some type of mythological, hybrid
animal he was in the process of taking on an overseas
journey.&#160; How quickly she had gone from seductress to a callow
calf and kid.&#160; He smiled at the man&#8217;s ignorance without
laughing. He felt that his girlfriend was ugly and noticed how
mutable the sight of anyone was: at one-time ugly and at another
time beautiful, at one-time virtuous and another point wicked, and
at one point victim and another time slut.&#160; It was not only
the physical dimensions that could vary from moment to
moment.&#160; The perception of a whole being could
change.&#160;&#160; He moved himself to the window to get away from
her hand and feigned a curiosity with the world outside. He rolled
down the window. At that moment they both had a similar jejune
feeling of the repetition of old things and new things not fully
connecting.&#160; It was indescribable to them both.&#160; Porn
kept asking herself if she was doing the right thing in forsaking
her responsibilities with her clients for the unknown of traveling
with him.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You look like you are car
sick,&#8221; said the driver.&#160; &#8220;My son always got that
way even a kilometer down the road when he was a boy.&#160; Matter
of fact that happens to him now--not quite as bad, though.&#160; I
can&#8217;t think how he survived the flight to Changmai.&#160;
That I&#8217;ll never know.&#8221;&#160; Nawin, to show proper
deference to an older man and to prove to himself that he
wasn&#8217;t churlish, looked toward the mirror and front
windshield and gave the whole frontal world a nod. The boy born of
the name Jatupon, was bleeding inside him.&#160; His brain waves
wiggled around like noodles.&#160; He was no better than this man.
They both had been born poor with limited opportunities.&#160; He
couldn&#8217;t laugh at him for any reason.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Are you going international or
domestic,&#8221; asked the driver to the twenty-five year
old.&#160; Again there was a chortle.&#160; &#8220;Why does that
question seem to make her laugh,&#8221; asked the taxi driver.
&#8220;That is very strange.&#160; That is a strange young
lady.&#8221;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Krap,&#8221; said Nawin gruffly,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why she is laughing.&#8221; &#8220;We are
going international.&#160; Eva Airlines. Eva Airlines, an
international flight to Japan.&#8221; Reiterated Nawin. He kept it
simple.&#160; He didn&#8217;t even want to think about
Montreal.&#160; The thought of accompanying an animal, of sorts, to
the other side of the world was too much. No sooner had he said it
than she reminded them both of the fact that she would be going to
her home first.&#160; Nawin had fallen into his own pensive
inclinations but unlike them he wanted the completion of his
thoughts.&#160; He was scanning his mutating neurological circuitry
for a possible answer to the enigma whom he called his wife.&#160;
Noppawan's flippant comment that the stoplight wouldn't get any
greener as she smiled and shut the door on him and his whore
troubled or inveigled him.&#160; One&#8217;s driveway wasn&#8217;t
exactly equipped with a stoplight so that one sentence bordered on
sarcasm.&#160; Her placid demeanor was like plastic and how she
behaved belied everything so how was he to know if she was
discontent with this arrangement if not jealous of it.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It was the first time that he would be
leaving her to travel abroad.&#160; He had offered to delay the
trip by a week or two until she had submitted her grades at
Assumption University, which Thais called A-back.&#160; Maybe
having his Porn stay over at their house the previous night was
disrespectful to his wife but nice or offensive behavior was based
upon one's guesswork on how society would interpret such situations
and unique situations like this were all the more impossible to
judge.&#160; His wife was definitely different.&#160; That was for
sure; but she was still a woman down deep even if she denied it
just as his American passport and name-change made him abstain from
bits of himself.&#160; A woman had instincts at suspecting a
man&#8217;s activities.&#160; A woman had jealous rages and
seductive lures that had a chance of keeping a man with her:
genetic programming from hundreds or thousands of female ancestors
who had experienced the promiscuity of husbands and were afraid
that they and their children would not be properly taken care of.
But there was certainly no chance of children.&#160; She slept with
him a few times as husband and wife in a motion of fulfilled and
completed consummation never to be repeated.&#160;&#160; Then she
went in to get herself sterilized.&#160; Why she needed to do both
was unclear.&#160; She was a mystery and steadfast in committing
herself to that vow they had made to each other when they were 14
or 15 years old to not live petty lives. Such was the gray in the
gray matter that enveloped them.&#160; Life with Noppawan had the
insatiability of an itch to a mosquito's bite and contained the
same pleasurable discomfort.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Taking a trip to Japan" thought the
taxi driver sarcastically.&#160; He wasn't certain how anyone could
afford to go there.&#160; He was stuck to the boundaries of the car
and he resented it; although from it, despite its limitations, he
was always introduced to people so different than he was.&#160;
They were the favored ones whose ideas were not curtailed to
traffic jams exacerbated by infuriatingly influential traffic
lights and accidents.&#160; Traffic accidents were such chaos
because smashed cars could not be moved until insurance agents came
to the scene to make their reports.&#160; Traffic policemen, who
could easily be bribed, were never to be trusted.&#160; The favored
people did not have everyday to roam the streets like homeless but
highly mobile mendicants, their every movement enslaved and
dictated by the pronouncement of street names called out from the
back seat. "Do young people like you have money to go off wherever
you wish?" The words pierced out of one who was pierced.&#160; The
ache tore open like a tenuous newly heeled scar with the blade
coming up to slit others.&#160; He knew that he had behaved
contrary to social instinct but he hadn&#8217;t been able to stop
himself.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Don't you know who this is?" asked the
whore with arrogant vehemence.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The taxi driver looked in the rear view
mirror at the brown-faced Nawin or Jatupon and asked, "No, should I
know you?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "No you shouldn't.&#160; Neither one of
us should know the other one. Just drive!" said Nawin although
again he winced from his darker alter ego that only became him when
he uttered its thoughts.&#160; He wasn't totally devoid of societal
programming of right and wrong no matter what he claimed to
Noppawan.&#160; Being respectful to one's elders and giving the
prayerful gesture of the "wai" (pronounced as &#8220;why&#8221;) to
one&#8217;s superiors did exist in him at certain times. He would
always stand up for the tribute paid to the king prior to a movie
although that was more from the idea of not offending the
sensibilities of others around him or, less altruistically, getting
himself possibly thrown out of the movie theatre. Furthermore, the
Jatupon who had brought cups of ice to customers when he was a boy,
the uneducated slave who had found himself spun up in noodles of
sidewalk restaurants until he was 15, often began to stretch like a
26 year old fetus locked up in a heavily fortified placenta.&#160;
He would feel how disparaged Jatupon often felt.&#160; He would
feel guilt when he disparaged others that seeped into his veins
while ghosts of yesteryear suddenly vexed him making him feel numb
and cold inside.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He too wanted to stop thinking and he
wished that his thoughts could be intruded with conversation.&#160;
"I just mean that I'm nobody important.&#160; I paint a
little.&#160; I'm going to Montreal for that reason."&#160; The
taxi driver was reticent.&#160; "Do you have many hours left
driving today?" Nawin asked him.&#160; Still there was no
answer.&#160; He threw the cigarette out of the opened
window.&#160; "Do you want a stick of gum," he asked the girl.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; "I have a tick tack in my mouth now but I'll
take your gum and save it for later.&#160; You might not offer it
again."&#160; She giggled and he smiled at her with the tightness
of his closed lips. She had lost her animal, and there she was as
his seductress.&#160; He kissed her and returned the headphones
over his ears. The savory taste of her mouth was in him.</p>

Chapter 2</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The acceleration that
took them out of Huamark and through other adjacent sections of the
city eventually led them to her area.&#160; He did not remember the
name of it:&#160; Bangkae, Bangplad, Bang-something.&#160; He paid
little attention to what his mistress said.&#160; Her voice often
seemed the strident spluttering of burning fuel in an engine that
couldn&#8217;t produce motion. King Ramkamhaeng was a bygone
entity.&#160; As soon as his model picked up some of her things
that she had forgotten to bring with her the previous day and they
had some breakfast, then Thailand would be a thing of the past
too.&#160; For how long he didn&#8217;t know.&#160; He was married
but it was one signature on many sheets of paper. The significance
of spilled ink could not be read unless, like many superstitious
Thais, he were to seek a fortuneteller-mendicant sitting on a sheet
or straw mat on a sidewalk or in a park.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Noppawan had her chance to go
with him.&#160; He had asked repeatedly.&#160; He had tacitly
exhorted (mostly with his eyes) but she had refused him.&#160;
Maybe she needed him to command her presence.&#160; Maybe in this
nebulousness of strong selfishness and altruism called a personal
relationship, so immediate and personal like finding oneself
enveloped in smoking and fiery dust, she needed constant reminders
that he cared about her more than any other entity selfishly and
altruistically. That would be the woman in her if there were such a
woman.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He tried to contemplate what love was
like for normal people.&#160; It was surely a dust storm one
invented in one&#8217;s mind to escape loneliness but then it
became intertwined in more neediness and consciousness of the
other&#8217;s feelings and thoughts so as not to be vanquished to
aloneness.&#160;&#160; An individual who was able to overcome the
grief of the loss of dopamine in the ephemeral and moribund high of
being in love would cling to his former pleasure-inducer as a
source of meaning in life&#8217;s vicissitudes.&#160; He and
Noppawan had done the same but they were less like individuals
finding themselves separately cast onto lifeboats in an ocean of
random waves for they found oceans of thoughts within themselves
that seemed more navigable to solid chunks of reality.&#160; They
needed each other less; or so he thought.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Thai women generally had
obsequious crying bouts in their rafts, but Noppawan, he argued,
was not a woman.&#160; She was female without womanity.&#160; She
was a female who advocated overcoming petty human existence for a
love of ideals, compassion, and the attempts at understanding the
human predicament.&#160;&#160;&#160; He couldn&#8217;t see into the
future to know if he would be returning to Thailand anytime soon to
be peered at through his wife&#8217;s thick dark framed
glasses.&#160; At present there were only the wills of three
individuals cowardly seeking meaning for themselves in a
unit.&#160; There were only these socialized wills rolling along on
a road in marginal darkness under the specious assumption that
there really was a destination.&#160; The sensory input of
traditional Thai music was coming to them from the front and back
speakers of the car that was their confinement.&#160; The radio
music, no matter if interpreted as harmonious or strident by the
three individuals, was a levee helping to block their pervasive
inundation of self-absorbing, mordant thoughts and reminded them
(the patriot and the pending expatriates) of their commonality as
Thais.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; They passed a mall where he and
Porn had gone shopping a month earlier.&#160; That day they had
spent together there was the levity of the stroll and the shiny
flash of credit cards in this Thai way of forgetting one&#8217;s
impoverished roots. Feeling on top of the world, he comported the
male gesture of having one arm clutching the other one behind his
back.&#160; It was a gesture of affluence in the stroll of the
shopper&#8217;s quest.&#160; At least twice when he encountered
friends of his from Silpakorn Art University with bags in their
hands he would talk to them for a half hour and somewhere into the
talk he used another male gesture of affluence.&#160; He would slip
a foot from a sandal and then slap it onto the floor loud as a
firecracker.&#160; The sandal would hit the floor like a hand
slapping against an impoverished peasant.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; They stopped in an alley smaller
than a side street called a &#8220;soi.&#8221; It was in between
many Mom and Pop businesses and there, crowded within, was her
apartment.&#160; He knew rooms like this well.&#160; They were
rented out for fifteen or twenty dollars a month (600 or 700 baht),
barren, hot, and unventilated as an attic. When she had gone in to
get her bags he felt less lonely to be momentarily rid of
her.&#160; Even now at age 26 but with thoughts at certain moments
suffering and dragging like a man of 50, there was just himself,
the real unit of one, and delude himself all he pleased he knew
that he could not find anyone more significant than
that.&#160;&#160; The only thing next to his heart, in the pocket
of his shirt, were the slides of his art depicting the naked and
dejected whores of Patpong that had ejaculated him into fame and
puffed up a latent ego in himself that thought that he was a higher
being than other Thais.&#160; He was keeping them there that day
because he wanted to momentarily hand them over to airport
authorities so they would not be harmed in airport
security.&#160;&#160; When she returned with an added bag that the
taxi driver plunked into the trunk the two men smiled at her and
she smiled back.&#160; After all, Thailand was the land of smiles
and every infant understood the advantages of smiling.&#160; To
bypass his surly temperament and increase friendly relations, Nawin
offered more breath fresheners or chewing gum for everyone.&#160;
No Thai would refuse such friendly gestures and the two of them
took from his hand greedily like tamed birds.&#160; Then he began
his old contemplation of why 2 was greater than 1 or why 3 was
greater than 2.&#160; It was an old argument of his wife.&#160; The
first time she posed it to him they both were 16 years old.&#160;
He had made the mistake of asking her to a dance.&#160; &#8220;Why
do two things coming in close proximity to each other have greater
value?&#8221;&#160; she asked.&#160; His only response had been
&#8220;A le nah?&#8221; meaning &#8220;What did you
say?&#8221;&#160; Neither one of them went to the dance but
straight to their bedrooms and their sullen thoughts.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Porn was, according to his thinking, an
&#8220;all right whore.&#8221;&#160; She didn&#8217;t cause him any
problems at all and it was for this reason that he carried her
along with him as a personification of his intellectual decadence
thereby increasing public intrigue with him.&#160; She was the
pretty doll he could swing about as a reminder of his one-man
school of art.&#160;&#160; He, Nawin Biadklang, could flaunt her
around as the premier example of the dark vision in his mind and
the sexual slavery of his nation all meshed together.&#160; He
would have to draw a lot in Montreal and sell everything he painted
to pay for any expenses the scholarship would not cover.&#160; She
preferred her title of model.&#160; He was not so heartless to deny
her this euphemism.&#160; She successfully relieved him of the
tension of his body and to be emitted of it like a squeezed
tangerine in such a good rhythmic fingering would well compensate
for the stress level of having to spend so much time with
her.&#160; He desired her a lot of the time so by most accounts of
love he did truly love her.&#160; Foremost, Noppawan did not object
to her.&#160; Matter of fact, she wanted Porn to relieve him.&#160;
She wanted him squeezed.&#160; She wanted the pus squished from his
brain without having to get dirty.&#160; She wanted to continuously
wear the glasses that caged her tepid orbs and to not succumb them
to rapturous non-Buddhist primal yearnings.&#160; She did not care
to dodge the aloneness of her thoughts through a rapturous delusion
that she was one partial being made whole in sex and love.&#160;
And yet by her account she did not want to mandate his
awareness.&#160; It was only by tripping on shadows and feeling
vapid equanimity that came after having absurdly given oneself over
so entirely to the sensation of pulling on one&#8217;s genitalia
that a man actually knew anything.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This whore was and was not his
typical whorehouse girl.&#160; On the day of their first meeting he
had been sketching runners and trees at a stadium near Assumption
University where his wife taught.&#160; His head was resting in a
fog until she materialized. There she was casting a shadow onto the
sun that was sedating him and wrapping him into himself in
sleep.&#160; There she was questioning him on his art and pointing
out her mommy, a skinny and frail thing, sitting on the other set
of bleachers.&#160; He found out that she was a dancer.&#160; There
was no surprise there. Her flirtatious gestures and the presence of
her frail mommy looking over at them and hoping the purchase would
take place were tacit but undeniable clues that she was poor and
wanted a male companion.&#160; That was no surprise either.&#160;
Yet beyond this calculated small talk or artifice was an ingenuous
mouth that glistened in guileless desire. She was a money
girl.&#160; That was obvious, and yet there was more.&#160; There
was infatuation and an accompanying mommy who was like an SOS. Porn
was a whore, but if he hadn&#8217;t been married, she could have
been more.&#160; Except for Noppawan, who was a flagrant novelty,
he couldn&#8217;t quite decipher how whores and wives were all that
different.&#160; Both baited the man for the fecundity of
prosperity and progeny.&#160; It was a survival response that was
selfish in base primeval instincts.&#160; It was human and
beautiful.&#160; It was filled with womanity.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; She turned up
the volume on her tape recorder and repeated, &#8220;Excusez-moi;
au revoir; oui; toilletes; papier hygienique.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Was that
the main reason for coming to your apartment: for the tape
recorder?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; She turned off the
machine without the least concern about a distraction deferring her
scholarship. &#8220;Oui,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but also my
favorite blouse, jeans, a necklace&#8212;see, isn&#8217;t it
beautiful--lots of things.&#160; A tape recorder is rather
important, I think. You don&#8217;t want me to be unable to
talk.&#8221;&#160; He nodded his head as he frowned wishing that
she couldn&#8217;t speak at all.&#160; She would have been all the
more beautiful mute and deaf.&#160; He had proposed getting up
early initially to compensate for his slow, pokey movements but not
as early as this and he resented having lost sleep for such
knicknacks.&#160; He didn&#8217;t feel that he should be subject to
listening to her palaver in Canada. His nod was that of
acquiescence the way the King Ramas had agreed with planned
activities of the imperialists to divert their attention.&#160; He,
however, was trying to divert a headache. He looked at the booklet
that was on her lap.&#160; She was unsuccessfully trying to imitate
a product published in Thailand as he had guessed a minute earlier
from the fact that the speaker on the tape sounded Thai.&#160; It
was the blind leading the blind, he thought.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You do know some English,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No,&#8221; she said.&#160; He
could imagine the palaver she would be saying on the streets of
Montreal and he yearned for his wife, Noppawan.&#160; He got the
taxi driver to turn right and park on the side of a street.&#160;
His eyes were fixed on a barren serenity of gravel and weeds that
was in the vicinity of a pier.&#160; The sun was now rising fully
and aided by a golden roofed temple on the other side of the river,
there was a silvery and golden glaze in the waters camouflaging the
sooty sediments that were diluted within.&#160; He wanted to go to
the gravel and eat along the side of begging dogs of which the
bodies were deflating like tires.&#160; He wanted to sit at one of
the red metallic tables on a plastic stool among a group of saffron
robed monks, with the scents of rice or noodles penetrating his
nostrils.&#160; He had to smile that such an aversion as twenty
baht meals still called to him pleasantly because they were the
foundation of memories that constituted his verdant youth.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;What are we doing?&#8221; she
asked</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;We&#8217;re eating,&#8221; he
said.&#160; &#8220;Come on, it will be fun to act like common
people,&#8221; he chuckled.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Common. I know common. Common is
having a treat of eating fried insects on the dirt road,
Nawin.&#160; Common is sleeping on a rug because you don&#8217;t
have a bed.&#160; Common is praying for the opportunity of having
one&#8217;s sandals fall apart or getting them trapped deep into
the soil of the rice field so as to have an excuse to get out of
the hamlet.&#160; Occasionally we paid an arm and a leg to the
owner of a truck who came once a day ten miles down a muddy road to
pick people up. Common, Nawin, is collecting rain water in those
big ceramic tubs that sit in front of the house, being stingy with
every drop of water when you wash your body, and then go to bed
exhausted without even eating dinner.&#160; Common is getting up at
5 a.m. to feed the water buffalo so that at 6 a.m. your father can
use it to plow the field.&#160; You don&#8217;t know anything about
the word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He did know.&#160; He bled from
knowledge but he frowned and for a moment he was taciturn fighting
back anger and memories.&#160; &#8220;Well, do whatever you damn
well please.&#160; I need out of this car and that is what
I&#8217;m doing.&#160; You can feast on what remains of the breath
fresheners.&#160; I for one am dining out.&#160; I&#8217;ll be back
in ten minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8220;When do we need to get on the
plane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;There&#8217;s plenty of
time,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;Plenty of time to eat another
meal in the airport before departing. You&#8217;ll get a high price
western meal at the airport.&#160; I guarantee it.&#8221;&#160; He
left the taxi and sat down meditating on the river flowing at a
distance.&#160; Soon the anger dissolved and his memories were
imprisoned.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The idea of paying on a
taxi where the meter continued to rise without his presence
enthralled him.&#160; Having lots of money was a novelty and
flaunting this novelty to patrician and plebian, proletariat and
CEO alike still engrossed him.&#160; Thais were culturally
programmed to give the &#8220;wai&#8221; to the Buddha and the monk
but in their hearts that steamed with greed as they cooked their
food on the streets, sold their trinkets from their sheets, worked
in office jobs, were government officers, part of an educated
middle class, and a million other activities, classifications, and
identities, this traditional greeting with the folded hands in
front of the face was deeply given in the secret regions of
subconscious ideas for those whom they thought of as rich.&#160;
And as he ate his pork laden noodle soup while the meter ticked on
he picked out the pork to feed the dogs; but in so doing he
glimpsed someone.&#160; Past the gravel were sidewalks and stores
and further was a department store.&#160; Next to it, beyond the
gaunt old woman on the sheet selling and squeezing rubber duckeys
in the hope of selling a few and having money to eat, a man
clanging bells with handless hooks above his cup, shoe repairmen
fixing souls, a kiosk of a key maker, and a blind mendicant with a
speaker and a microphone singing a strident folk tune, was
someone.&#160; It was a person who turned him to stone, froze him
like an iceberg, mortified him, and pulled out his wounded
child.&#160; It was a strange composite: at one moment appearing a
bit like his brother, Kazem, and at one moment like the youngest of
his elder brothers, Suthep.&#160; For a second or two as he saw
this cook at a distance, he couldn&#8217;t remember the name of
Suthep&#8212;he who had been so innocuous but in his apathy had
harmed him the most.&#160; Ten or eleven years had gone by.&#160;
He wondered how he was supposed to know anymore: was this man one
or the other or neither of them.&#160; Another blind beggar began
to sing a song in a microphone linked to a portable speaker.&#160;
He was being lead by his wife.&#160; They came to his table singing
a louder song more stridently than the one he heard at a
distance.&#160; The sun was feeling hot and it made him dizzy and
mad as Akhenaten in Ancient Egypt.&#160; Nawin, the legal alias of
Jatupon, was feeling a weight death.&#160; His whole ideas and
feelings were discombobulated.&#160; He took out twenty baht
wedging it under the canister containing vinegar and peppers.&#160;
He walked quickly to the car and cowered himself in the back seat
in movement toward the airport.</p>

Chapter 3</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Their parents were dead; the cremation
ceremony was over, and life went on: he internally recited,
swallowed his whispered whit of air, and regurgitated the
aphorism.&#160; Its cold, laconic and impersonal meaning was
assumed an efficacy to change on this propelling Earth like the
odious taste of medicine and so he could not fail to believe that
it was true since there was nothing to his knowledge to replace it
with.&#160; The present moment ravished and trashed all former
beings and, like a mountebank, sold its new products as the true
goods. To Jatupon, the youngest, there was a vermilion color to the
day.&#160; It was no wonder. The present had come upon him as
inconspicuously as the gait of the monk's orange robe in the subtle
movements that philosopher made during their time of mourning.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Carrying suitcases and bags with his
brothers and a woman of Chinese complexion, he sensed the rapacious
discord of Bangkok-- virulent and paralyzing as ennui for the rich
and servitude for the poor--and so he lagged behind them.&#160;
There had been a time that he would have sniffed at this new city
like one of the myriad crazed but gently starving dogs (after all,
in certain areas of the streets, pheromones and urinary molecules
dominated over the odors of car exhausts) but, as he guessed,
Bangkok was always more tempting from afar. Even though he had
repined for a more promised land he did not expect that even if he
were to live somewhere in "Euro-American Bangkok" (Banglampool,
Silom, and Sukumvit roads with their seven day a week travelers
check cashing windows) his life would be any different than his
situation at present; nor would it be any worse than his life in
Ayutthaya unless he were to starve.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Still, he felt apprehension; and
like a restive boy he slowly dragged his suitcases. He imagined
remote Hill Tribe villages on the sidewalks and himself taking his
suitcases through the bedrooms of naked girls as if, like one of
the kings of the Chakri dynasty with his many wives, he were to
declare to them "Honeys, I'm home." The dreaminess belied a
gloom.&#160; If Jatupon were to think of one positive trait about
himself that late afternoon he might have thought that the
ejaculation of his semen, which he conducted alone, disgorged
extremely far-- so far he had sunk into a shaky gray within himself
that he couldn't see outside of any void unless it had a rope
attached to it.&#160; Even the fetid air intimidated him.&#160; He
felt intellectually obtuse.&#160; He was like a dog carried by an
owner (a woman in a skirt, riding side saddle on a motorcycle) that
squealed its head off when the motorcycle skid and floundered onto
one side.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Staring down as his brothers, his
owners, pulled the invisible leash, he knew that they condemned
him, the laggard; and nominally, that condemnation made him feel
compelled to look down more often than what he would have done
otherwise. Still, when they crossed over to another sidewalk
bustling with pedestrians he was forced to look up since he was
inadvertently bowling his suitcases against the pins of
strangers.&#160; In so doing, he noticed a store windowsill
besieged by an orderly society of ants.&#160; He was beginning to
acknowledge that Buddhist principles were curtailed by reality: a
few ants allowed to live with a human became a hundred easily;
multiplying mosquitoes brought disease and pain, and that one's
immune system killed bacteria, viruses, and protozoa because murder
was stamped into the natural order that no human will could
bypass.&#160; And yet this demonstrated that the Earth, herself,
was alive and full of creative potential.&#160; It was this
mesmerizing dynamism that most lured his eyes.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The city was fetid as his older
brother's shoes in the back of his girl friend's car (the car that
had brought them here); and yet its billboards and tall buildings
were opulent.&#160; He imagined them glazed in morbidly saffron or
vermilion dust the color of a monk's robe and the color of blood
and death. All the pedestrians were individually and rapaciously
galvanized but banging against each other less systematically than
the ants.&#160; They were ebullient like the bouncing of hair on a
schoolgirl's back since most of them were shoppers.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The brothers and the Chinese Thai woman
passed another street.&#160; Near it was the edge of a small park
with one blended shadow of the fronds of palm trees spread out
among a patch of grass and providing a visual respite from traffic
exhaust and pavement that seemed to define the city.&#160; Here he
was slithering about like a snake acclimating to both a foreign
environment and the alien skin that he was now wearing. These three
weeks had made him unreal.&#160; His parents had ridden in the car
alone; there was the car accident; then a cremation and the selling
of property; the drive from Ayutthaya; the night at someone&#8217;s
house in some type of a fever or hallucination; mosquito bites
under a net; and himself turning into some type of caricature in a
comic book or cartoon.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Whereas many other boys had books and
knowledge he had his comics. He didn't know anything about the
techniques of art although he had thumbed through some pictures
from a book at a library in Ayutthaya. He had never even been
exposed to algebra or other intellectual exercises that brought one
in touch (so to speak) with abstract realities. He had heard of the
Internet and assumed it was the brand name of a certain computer
but wished to know for sure. He knew that his poverty created his
ignorance and felt his ignorance made him stupid. For him there was
nothing but day to day living twisting about like a noodle fried in
the juice of itself under the hot Thailand sun.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; There was a secondary trait about him
that despite his bleakly gray and vermilion self-deprecation he was
pleased that he possessed.&#160; His 14 years of life had provided
him with at least enough acclimating instinct or reflexes that, as
they crossed the road, zigzagging through stalled traffic, his feet
and ears performed a specific cautionary duality of quickness in
speed and breaks.&#160; This allowed him to retreat from
motorcycles without headlights that were swerving around multiple
lanes of cars.&#160; Even within Ayutthaya, which was conspicuously
absent of operable traffic lights, he had never had an accident.
There was that time that he had flown off of a motorcycle taxi and
over a vendor who had been wheeling his cart when the motorcycle
had run into his toasted buns glazed in feces-tinted Ovaltine, but
that was a different type of incident altogether.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Across the street culinary workers of
the sidewalk poured soup and scooped rice dishes into plastic bags
sealed with rubber bands or put the plates of food on metallic
tables. So many city residents (all of whom lived in apartments)
did not possess kitchens from some law or another. This, he
supposed, was good. It had provided he and his family with an
existence.&#160; It did the same for them. One worker who rested on
a red stool enthralled him.&#160; Without any specific gestures or
words sent to him, he nonetheless felt her listlessness and knew
her anguish.&#160; He knew the 4000 baht that many indigent souls
received.&#160; It was their permit to live; and to get this permit
to ride in life they had to harness and ensnare the creative force
that had conceived them and were them, and then allow themselves to
be subservient seven days a week in their robotic roles of
reflexes.&#160; He saw another one wring out a washcloth and clean
another table.&#160; He could imagine her travail just as he
understood the travail of those around him on overpasses: the
emaciated elderly with cups in their hands seemed to cluster on and
under every pedestrian overpass.&#160; To be homeless, he thought,
would be more horrific than the moments at one's death: a travail
of being worthless and lost, where dangling blue from a rope
inveigled the imagination that could not fathom a means to get 6000
baht and pull oneself off of a park bench. He felt: "I have been
where you are with a hair net on my head, many late nights
splintered on a wooden stool, or placid on a red plastic stool,
strength thwarted, and with angular crowds stumbling over
me."&#160; Almost without thinking it, he felt the horror as he
struggled for words; and since he did not have his journal with
him, he tried to memorize the feeling.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He remembered those years of nights in
Ayutthaya when his work had ended and he was free of the vending
cart, and embraced within the black smog of busses.&#160; Then
there was a reprieve from the gaseous smoke of cooked food (grilled
pork and chicken) trapped between canopy roofs and sidewalk. His
reprieve and liberation was only in comics borrowed from a
newsstand. It was a personal life--a bit of himself in a vicarious
existence.&#160; The words under the pictures would often zoom
across the interior of his skull in his drowsiness like cars on a
speedway and he would not comprehend anything much before falling
asleep at one of the tables.&#160; In sleep he would not
exist.&#160; Cartoon images would run amuck.&#160; His pent up
needs would flow in action and adventure although his likeness
would not be in the dreams.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; If thought were a product made from the
raw material of feeling, he felt more than thought: "Your reflexive
and monotonous perfunctory days and nights are gloomy in
starlessness. Face draped on the backs of your hands folded on the
table, you almost look as if you are making the gesture of 'wai' or
praying to Buddha." He remembered that seconds before he was in
those minutes of sleep, at the end of the work nights, he prayed
for a way out or that community and connectedness could be gained
within his limited life.&#160; He walked by the stranger. He walked
past twenty others. With his eyes he bestowed onto them
blessings.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He continued to follow his brothers
through perennial steps and time and swayed alone as lifeless as
wet laundry hanging on balconies during the dry season. The fetid
one slammed him with poignant expletives to which the second eldest
smiled and nodded his head.&#160; Suthep, however, had childish
sensitivities of his own that life had not yet hacked from him but
when Jatupon quickened his pace to walk near him Suthep looked over
toward him with silent rage.&#160; Jatupon just turned away and
sucked in his bottom lip. It was true that weeks had passed since
the death of their parents and it was so that life went on--that it
was quickly manufactured and quickly hit the dust bin like any worn
out or broken commodity; but, he argued to himself, an admission of
their own pain and a kind smile would have helped to keep his
boyhood suppressed and his manhood poised.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jatupon was still nonplused. The
present was an undercurrent in his inundating thoughts.&#160; His
vision was often cracked and misted in suppressed tears and his
eyes burned from his sweat seeping into them.&#160; He felt
disoriented and although it was apparent, it didn't seem to evoke
sympathy. In virtually his first words that day he hoarsely spoke
incommunicably, cleared his throat, and then yelled over to Kazem,
the second eldest, that he needed to go to the bathroom.&#160;
Kazem stopped walking and told the youngest, Jatupon (to whom he
nicknamed "Jatuporn"), to hold his water until they were
"home."&#160; The word &#8220;home&#8221; did not make any
impression on the youngest who was now wondering if they would be
spending the rest of their lives walking in this
fashion.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He felt that they were sinking in an abyss of negative
probabilities.&#160; Concerning the pejorative comment about
holding his water, it was no worse than being called
&#8220;Jatuporn.&#8221;&#160; He was used to it.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A facial muscle below Kazem's left eye
began to twitch immediately before they again started walking.
Conscious of Kazem's disposition, Jatupon became less disconcerted
and more guarded, hurrying but maintaining a consistent space
between himself and his brothers.&#160; How strange, Jatupon
thought, that the fetid one did not have the same physical
antagonism: it was strictly mental as if the thought of the
youngest was so repugnant as to be beyond a physical response. He
began to stumble with the bags until Kumpee's girlfriend stopped
their advancement to help him carry some of his load.&#160; Her
smile was wide against her pale pigment; and her Chinese complexion
looked at odds to Kumpee, the oldest and darkest of the fraternal
misadventurers.&#160; Jatupon was jealous of her relationship with
the fetid one but this gesture of pulling away from his brothers to
take one of his bags ameliorated any negativity that the appearance
had not
counteracted.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The journey from the parking garage and
down through the hectic whims of Bangkok traffic seemed
inordinately long to him and silently he objected to being led this
way forfeiting friends and consistency he had always known in
Ayuttaya. The sidewalk and road went over a canal.&#160; A woman
with baskets of fruit dangling from the ends of a bamboo pole that
was on her shoulders must have made Kumpee&#8217;s girlfriend
hungry since no sooner was she back with her beau than the exigency
of eating had driven the herd to seek a bowl of tom yam soup with
noodles.&#160; Under the canvas, eating and sinking morbidly into
himself as he looked out over the cabin-shacks that were along the
canal, he listened to Kumpee and Kazem.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "You're the one who wanted to move here
and so I said, 'Yes, little brother.&#160; Let me fulfill your
wishes and needs.&#160; It is my duty as an elder brother."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I never said
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You were always saying
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Back up.&#160; That was before
the accident and it was just talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Man, you did not make any
objections. We sold off their things and there wasn&#8217;t one
objection from any of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know then that
you would be pocketing the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;In other words, you wanted to
move over here and now that we are over here you are raising
objections as if now we should just get back into the car and go
back.&#160; That is crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I was in a daze. I admit
it.&#160; I let you lead us around.&#160; We don&#8217;t even know
anyone here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;That isn&#8217;t entirely true;
but even if it turns out that he doesn&#8217;t help us any at least
we are in a large city where there are more opportunities than
working in restaurants like this one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220; I want that money&#8212;or a
share of it at anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;For what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;So that I won&#8217;t have to
beg for a bowl of soup in places like this&#8212;so that if you and
Natenapa take off somewhere&#8221; (Kumpee&#8217;s girlfriend, who
was listening to them, now looked away and reached for the pitcher
of water that was at the table) &#8220;that the money doesn&#8217;t
go with you.&#8221;&#160; She poured water into her glass, sipped
it once, and reached into her purse for her makeup.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;It is Thai tradition that the
eldest brother is supposed to keep the inheritance for the younger
ones.&#160; If you question that you don&#8217;t have any sense of
right and wrong. If you have a problem with that you have a problem
with the way things are and have always been.&#160; But even if I
were to run away tomorrow you wouldn't have lost much.&#160; None
of it was worth anything.&#160; Look at these jeans with the holes
in the knees and the pockets.&#160; If I want to start spending
everything for myself I would have started with some new clothes
and instead of dragging you to Bangkok with me I would have left
all of you in Ayutthaya, wouldn&#8217;t I?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; "You buy jeans and cut out the areas around
the knees so that doesn&#8217;t prove much.&#160; Just see to it
that the money doesn't fall from the holes and that you keep
remembering the duties of an elder brother to the younger
ones."</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On foot again with his brothers and the
China woman, he kept wishing to be a boy that year that his parents
opened what they referred to as a real restaurant.&#160; He wished
for the strange faces in the familiar space: an area no different
than a garage with some metallic tables and chairs in the center
and woks, burners, a refrigerator, and Coke machine in the front.
It had taken the family so many years of working on the street to
be able to afford this space. This restaurant was more legitimate
and less beggarly in appearance although not exempt from
taxes.&#160; His parents were exhilarated for a while until they
discovered that the added customers only compensated for rent and
taxation and the same subsistence level prevailed. Soon the mundane
set in and the discomfort of working on the streets was forgotten.
Then he thought of a better time: that sweet time that very young
children have in harmony with the parents' wishes and the fruition
of love.&#160; He could see himself pouring ice and water into
small metallic cups and bringing them to the customers on the
sidewalk or making his foray into salesmanship by draping from his
arms the jasmine rosaries that his mother linked together from a
long needle.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One day, as that boy, had he not just
looked down briefly to zip his pants and found that they did not
fit all that well; and that, no longer a cute or special one, he
wasn't the same (or wasn't perceived the same) being within his new
clothes?&#160; A metamorphosis had altered him to a taller and more
aggravating expense and only by working hard could he avert the
faces of scorn.&#160; In those years in some bedroom or another he
found some peace. The plastic blinds had the same sounds of fingers
wedged between them as they bounced around in the December breeze
or in a June storm; and the piecemeal environment seen in the
crevices of those blinds were of the same trash cans on the same
pavement near some gravel. That had been reassuring to him. Now, he
had been extracted from that environment.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Walking on, morose as the abyss of his
subconscious disgorged like a geyser, he thought of his boyhood in
school satiated in learning.&#160; There had indeed been such a
boyhood in such a time brief as a few days of Bangkok winter that
makes homeless dogs and cats shiver before temple walls when
fortunate enough to wander into such an animal sanctuary.&#160;
Learning had been a series of refreshing stimuli slapping up
against him like a cool breeze. It had stimulated him and had
planted in him an appetite.&#160; It was then taken away from him
leaving only the wistfulness and the barren days squirming around
like noodles in pork soup.&#160; At the aunt's insistence his
mother and father had paid for him to go to a poor Buddhist school
run by the monks. The monks had been impressed by his academic
cleverness, and soon, at their persuasion, his parents had paid for
him to attend special classes as well. During those three years he
had only worked in the summers; and the last of those summers was
the end to a consistent time of academic learning. They rented him
off to pick coconuts from a woman's orchard and didn't see much
point in dismissing the added revenue. The aunt, with her excess of
money, intervened with special tutors and home-school
teachers.&#160; It lasted for a time until she became bored with
overseeing it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During the trip here an accident had
occurred on the highway from Ayuttaya to Bangkok and the congestion
made irascible beings used to the quick weltering motion of freedom
trapped in their own thoughts.&#160; Horns, at that time sounded
from all directions and Kumpee, the fetid one, at times irascibly
chewed the fetid fruit called durian or slowly slurped from the
beer can in his hands allowing the liquid in his mouth to spread
and re-spread before swallowing.&#160; He wanted to step out of the
car and punch someone but instead he bit into the heart of the
durian.&#160; When the girlfriend's car gained enough freedom to
interweave within the slowness (a slowness that caused their minds
to be more lamenting), Kumpee, at that time, made their way out of
the last lanes and pulled into a town to get another beer. He had
hardly entered the town when he fell asleep for a second and
swerving to escape hitting a tuc tuc upon awakening (a tuc tuc
being a big golf-cart taxi) or a bicycle rickshaw, the car nearly
hit a truck and then nicked a fruit cart that was being pushed
along the side of the road. Kumpee, burdened and desiring for speed
and escape, drove on. During that second of the near miss with the
truck, Jatupon felt that it was their destiny--their karma-- to
have the same fate that their parents had experienced weeks
earlier. He found himself disappointed to be alive but sensed that
he was alone in this. Even if such a thought flashed before his
brothers, they were older and quickly regained that cold detachment
as if their psyches were fully evolved as separate entities. They
portrayed, in legitimate or feigned smiles, that they no longer
felt that the fate of the parents was interlinked to that of the
sons. Suthep, who was just a year and a half older than Jatupon,
had not been so convincing.&#160; When he felt that he was
unobserved he seemed troubled and twice looked out the back
window.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Kumpee, deciding to sleep, drove a
little further in the same direction to his friend's house.&#160;
He was apologetic.&#160; After all, Bangkok (or Krung Thep Maha
Nakhon) was only 45 miles from Nakhon Si Ayutthaya but to
experience traffic problems in Thailand was like no other, and to
have sold the parents&#8217; possessions after burning the bodies
of the mother and father before the inevitable rot (a ubiquitous
ordeal so individually personal) was like no other. They were
exhausted and needed someplace to stay. The friend welcomed them in
without the least reservation.&#160; Kumpee and Kazem put rice mats
on the floor. Then they began to tie up the tent of the mosquito
net by stringing it up against light fixtures and unused nails that
stuck out of walls.&#160; Suthep and Jatupon became aware that
their masculine images of themselves were dependent on being a
builder of the house, and so they quickly secured two sagging
corners so that they would not be badgered for feminine
subservience.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; That night, under the net, Jatupon
considered the mosquito stealth: that it waited for the concluding
restless mumbling of his two eldest brothers who were rehashing
where they would go long-term and what they would do. The mosquito
waited; and the minute that they fell asleep its wings cut through
the black air and time with the buzz of a monotonous chant.&#160;
The mosquito carried a wicker fan called a "balabot" that monks
used to hide their faces as they gave the air their morbid and
sonorous drones.&#160; He heard the mosquito shuffling around the
room under the net.&#160; There were times, throughout the night,
that he questioned if some less supernatural version of a mosquito
had bitten him and had given him dengue fever which might have
brought on these hallucinations, or if he was experiencing
withdrawal from not having used drugs or sniffed glue for a while.
It did not occur to him that a third possibility might have been
the variety of chemical substances already in his body mixed with
the new amphetamines that he had popped into his mouth an hour
earlier while in the bathroom of Kumpee's friend.&#160; It was a
well-known fact that metropolitan bus drivers in every city popped
amphetamines; and so to him it had been vitamins fortifying him
against depression and lethargy.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As he walked with his brothers and the
&#8220;Chinawoman&#8221; through the heat and smoke of the sidewalk
restaurants, he remembered having been very hot the previous night
and how he had felt so miserably trapped under the mosquito net
like a fish in the web and snare of its net.&#160; He was sick but
it did not last for very long. According to his memory this strange
entity as large as himself shuffled under the net from one corner
to the next and the sickness of his stomach was replaced by a
queasy and tightening horror while he cowered in the embrace of his
legs. Thinking himself in a net where there was no extrication he
experienced the adrenalin of bravado.&#160; He wanted to confront
his fears.&#160; Trying to reach for a religion to formulate a
rational perspective in the irrational, he argued that the snare
outside had to be less poignant than the snare of gluttonous
appetites that were the cell, the bunk, and the chained wall within
the underground prison that was he.&#160; This mosquito evoked in
him, or he invoked in himself, such trepidation that he imagined an
equal: prehistoric peoples of Thailand watching their halcyon
harmony with nature execrably disparaged in the vehement winds of a
hurricane--the trees along the river, which had offered protection
now torn and lethally slapped at them.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; The mosquito landed, crawled, and looked at
the bodies on the floor.&#160; "Everyone is separated out into
little forts. The others are under two different nets," it flared
its voice in a quasi-question without looking at Jatupon's face.
"Who are these creatures?" it asked.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; "My brothers"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; "There&#8217;s one woman,&#8221; it said
pugnaciously.&#160; &#8220;They can&#8217;t all be your brothers.
Let&#8217;s have an inventory. Be specific!"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; "My eldest brother's friend and my brother,
Kazem, are under one tent. My brother, Kumpee, and his girlfriend
are in a second tent.&#160; My brother, Suthep, is here with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;And you I know.&#160; Don't you
think this is a bit overdone: three forts around a few microscopic
insects?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jatupon opened his mouth but failed to
say anything. Then he closed his mouth in fear of an insect flying
into it.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;At any rate, why isn&#8217;t one
tent used throughout the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#160; I
didn&#8217;t ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you a little
dummy,&#8221; it said.&#160; &#8220;Considering the fact that one
large tent spread throughout the room would be a more economical
investment than three smaller ones, one would think that you would
care to inquire about it logically.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;We aren&#8217;t renting them .&#160;
They are the host&#8217;s and it would be impolite to ask such
questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;&#8217;They are the host&#8217;s
and it wouldn&#8217;t be polite to ask those
questions,&#8217;&#8221; it mocked. &#8220;You are so Thai through
and through: one dummy in a nation of dummies. Here, let me look at
this dummy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; After a thorough examination of
Suthep&#8217;s body like a doctor or a depraved sexual stalker, it
turned away from the one sleeping and spoke Jatupon&#8217;s
disparaging nickname of &#8220;Jatuporn&#8221; disdainfully.&#160;
Then it told him that he and it would be playing cards.&#160; It
shuffled its body from corner to corner and then shuffled the
cards.&#160; One card became thwarted and dislodged from the
uniform movement.&#160; It flipped face up and showed a still life
of his parents who were expressionless as mannequins. They were a
couple of a dark pigment (he from birth and she with her Chinese
skin all burnt and wrinkled brown).&#160; She was naked but wearing
a hair net and he was without his usual cap but was wearing a
loincloth that had been soiled by his weekend work in the rice
fields in the rural outskirts of the city. The mosquito quickly
buried the card into the others face down.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Lets talk of them, the
ashes that they be.&#160; They make up one of two groups of people
in your life and these categories of individuals need to be
discussed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why are you crying?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Seeing them makes me miss
them.&#160; They died in a horrible accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Accidents
abound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;&#160; We had to burn
their bodies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;That&#8217;s done.&#160;
You don&#8217;t want them rotting in the streets. &gt;From what I
heard, they made excellent firewood in the incinerator.&#160; What
is there to cry about?&#160; They fulfilled the quest of their
lives.&#160; It was the only decent thing they ever did: becoming a
fireball.&#160; What is there to cry about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;They are gone.&#160; They were
my parents and I loved them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You are sorry for the pain they
experienced.&#160; I suppose that is decent of you; but most of
that love is just like not questioning why there are three nets in
this room instead of one.&#160; You, Thais, are so subservient to
your cultural definitions of right and wrong.&#160; What silly
things you all are.&#160; You are specifically foolish having the
loyalty of a dog that is kicked, fed, and comes back for
more.&#160; You are too Thai. It is absolutely
sickening.&#8221;&#160; It again glanced at Suthep. &#8220;Tell me
about this one on the mat with you.&#160; Is he as
stupid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Are you going to hurt him and
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Possibly; or just allow you to
hurt yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Tell me about
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;He is the third eldest
brother.&#160; He is a litter older than me.&#160; He likes Thai
boxing and snookers.&#160; I don&#8217;t know what to say. I
don&#8217;t know what you want.&#160; He is my brother.&#160; I
love him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;There you go with that
word.&#160; Do you think that they, your parents, loved
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;That&#8217;s what you think but
that isn&#8217;t what you know.&#160; I want what you know from
what you have repressed.&#160; I want the truth.&#160; I want to
enlighten you, or for you to enlighten yourself.&#160; It&#8217;s a
misnomer, you know.&#160; It isn&#8217;t really light at all in
either color or weight.&#160; Enlightenment is hard and dark.&#160;
Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ve never considered
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I know you
haven&#8217;t.&#8221;&#160;&#160; It paused.&#160; &#8220;You know,
I can read your thoughts. Why are you trying to memorize everything
I&#8217;m saying.&#160; You flatter me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I want to put it in my journal
but it is buried in one of my bags.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I see.&#160; I&#8217;m glad you
write.&#160; I think you should write or draw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why not? As an indictment of
love if nothing else.&#160; I&#8217;m wondering what you think
about your mother having four sons.&#160; Really five including the
miscarriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t know.&#160; I suppose
she loved Children. She loved raising them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;She needed children.&#160; Not only
did her body push her to make copies of herself to preserve her DNA
but also she needed the distractions from her own
thinking&#8212;from love gone awry.&#160; She had married a
tyrant.&#160; The only thing they shared was the scheming of easily
cobbled projects to make a tiny bit of money they always hoped
would make them filthy rich.&#160; The rebellion against her family
and sexual felicity with his large genitalia had been eroded in
time. She became conscious of his piggish habits.&#160; She was
always thinking about being alienated from her former family,
which, if she had stayed with them, would have allowed her to live
a comfortable life.&#160; Children were her distraction but when
they were older she resented their independence.&#160; As far as
your father is concerned, he loved you even more:&#160; he loved
chasing after you as if you were a cockroach that he wanted to
smash.&#160; He got your brothers to help him stomp on
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;How do you know that the need to
preserve DNA makes a mother love?&#8221; Jatupon whined
sullenly.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I read it in a comic
book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jatupon became taciturn.&#160; His head
hurt and he wanted to vomit.&#160; He couldn&#8217;t get up.&#160;
He tried to stand up but couldn&#8217;t do so.&#160; He tried to
vomit in a cup but nothing came up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You might as well stay where you
are at.&#160; If you go into the bathroom for more pills or slip
into your bag for some glue you might be able to discombobulate my
voice like a child spinning around in the grass but ultimately
you&#8217;ll fall into me and the mordant words will be all the
more deleterious. Besides, it is still my hand and there are more
cards to play. It tossed another card from the deck his way.&#160;
It was Kumpee's girl friend.&#160; It was her face and
shape.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Yes, Jatupon said,
"She's a lovely card" and the mosquito nodded his head
disdainfully.&#160; Then it clapped its feet and said, "One baht
for the human's ability to at least recognize physical
beauty."&#160; Jatupon looked on the table and there appeared a one
baht coin with a naked China woman engraved on it.&#160; He picked
it up.&#160; It's weight, which was always equal to that of play
money, had become less; and there was a continual sensation that
even though it rested in his finger tips it was being pulled
lightlessly away from him to fall endlessly into an inconvertible
currency. He watched it vaporize into a gas.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;She is one of the second group who has
no special significance to you at all and yet from her your life
has been changed.&#160; People like this might be helpful and even
compassionate but at the end of the day they won&#8217;t stay with
you.&#160; They are evanescent nectar in the dissolution of events
and time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Only two groups?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Only two unless you make up a
third.&#160; All I know of the future is from the perspective of
today.&#8221;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Catered to the limitations of Jatupon's
entomological knowledge, this gigantic mosquito was male and a
bloodsucker nonetheless.&#160; It looked into his intimate space
with such a bold stare that he felt that it could easily seduce him
in as its prey--that the survival of the fittest reigned with the
hegemony of its kind just as micro-organisms always get the last
meal. As he saw its eyes he suddenly knew the sadistic fun it was
having with its mind games, and the cruel hunting games of cats and
their dead mice.&#160; Deeper into its eyes he saw a starving child
and a vulture awaiting on a rock, the fight for dominion of species
and nations, and the sexual aggression of making love among
mankind.&#160; He felt like walking meat; and he knew that all
animals felt the same of their own lives ceaselessly. He grieved
for them.&#160; The mosquito knew this intuitively and began to
laugh at him for his sensitivity and his na&#239;ve animistic
thinking, which like a child, made animals conscious and
sagacious.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; "You aren't real, you know, but the fever of
my own brain," said Jatupon to curtail his vision.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s not start the
reality game.&#160; I&#8217;ll make this simple so that even you
can understand it.&#160; It foils others I enlighten who give me
the same argument.&#160; I say to them that they, who create ideas,
will die in a hundred years but an idea that they might have has
the possibility of living on.&#160; To the idea, I say, the man
would not seem real.&#8221;&#160; Then he obfuscated. &#8220;Didn't
you read in an encyclopedia one time that the American president,
Abraham Lincoln, said, 'In the civil war it is quite possible that
God's purpose is something different from the purpose of either
party--and yet the human instrumentalities, working just as they
do, are of the best adaptation to effect his purpose.'"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I don't understand what you are
meaning by that.&#160; I didn't understand that long sentence when
I read it anyhow."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; "You don't understand subtle and abstract
meanings because you are uneducated.&#160; You sometimes dabble
here and there with an encyclopedia in the library and then you
forget everything you've read when you understand it at all,&#8221;
said the mosquito in a contumelious air. "Only the dreamer is the
illusion.&#160; Not the dream. The dreamer sinks back with the
dirt."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; It tossed that card like a coin from its
gangling talon tips. The card enlarged to a life-sized form and
moved toward Jatupon. He almost felt seduced by it as it moved
around him in its mating dance.&#160; The mosquito laughed harder
and then said that not only had he and his brothers relinquished
their homeland in Ayutthaya on account of her but that she was a
trap or a symbol of a trap. It was not just she, he
explained.&#160; It was all of them.&#160; Love and marriage was a
specie preserving drug induced into a man to keep him bound and
limited through passion, fear of loneliness, and obligation."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Then I should feel sorry for my elder
brother if it is a sickness like how I'm feeling now.&#160; I mean
I was feeling really sick but now I must still be sick if I'm
imagining you.&#160; I wish I were able to tell what is happening
to me now.&#160; It is like suffering the withdrawals or dengue
fever."&#160; Slowly forcing himself beyond his cowardly pose,
Jatupon got up and opened his suitcase.&#160; He took out two warm
cans of Coca Cola.&#160; He opened the tabs and slid one to the
mosquito that drank up.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;It isn&#8217;t quite the nectar
of blood but it is okay when one is thirsty,&#8221; it
commented.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He was like a wounded soldier who
perceived that the enemy was another victim in the war and so he
wanted to sit down near this opposing peer.&#160; Jatupon crept
near it and gradually sat on a mat. A minute later, after not being
eaten, his confidence grew and he felt like confessing his soul to
the insect as if the mosquito&#8217;s appearance were only that
mask Thai monks hid behind when they said their chants.&#160;
"Kumpee said he would live with us but I guess he might mean that
now. After all, his girlfriend is with him.&#160; He only talked to
her on our way here." He paused and thought deeply once again. "I
don't like what you say but it's honest. I have no one to talk
with, you know.&#8221;&#160; He thought of this mosquito as a
spirit who came through the burning of incense placed at a
stupa.&#160; "I don't have anyone to be honest with me and all of
the friends I once had I've had to leave. Would you visit me in
Bangkok?" He spoke with such innocence that the mosquito had to
smile bashfully and look away from the awkwardness of knowing that
only a child believes that mother and father are extensions of his
own body; only a child walks into the forest with a kind stranger
where he is bound to a tree, raped and murdered; and only one
warped in the wisdom gained in tragedy finds himself inseparably
bound by every stern, euphonious truth uttered by a monster.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Would I accept the invitation to come
to Bangkok to bite you and inject you with malaria? No, I'm afraid
I would not be able to accept such an invitation at this time and
you shouldn't be extending it.&#160; Always remember that truth is
lethal.&#160; To know and to be aware of many things is like a man
too fat for his house and this obese pig of a man is forced onto
the streets where he can't tolerate the heat and cold because of
his flab; and then I come along and suck through his baboonish skin
before he knocks off.&#160; I certainly would accompany you if it
were not for there being truth in the adage that a mosquito could
never live in Bangkok because the pollution would kill him
off."&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Then the mosquito's eyes were those of
the second eldest brother, Kazem, and Jatupon was with him in the
bathroom where he had taken the pills.&#160; Kazem lifted up
&#8220;Jatuporn&#8217;s&#8221; bare legs onto his shoulders;
inserted himself; and rode. Jatupon realized that he was
hallucinating this because there was the mosquito before him. He
felt ill.&#160; He just wanted to get out of the confines of the
mosquito net.&#160; He just wanted to brush his teeth.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The next thing Jatupon dreamt or knew
the third eldest one, Suthep, put a cold washcloth on his forehead
and then had him take some aspirin. As Jatupon gluttonously
swallowed the pills down his gullet he kept wondering if it were
cocaine. Suthep vanished and then there was the mosquito again. In
a transformed madness, the mosquito became Kazem; and this brother
kept riding him painfully while Jatupon wondered if Kumpee, the
fetid one, had run off permanently with his
&#8220;Chinawoman.&#8221;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Somewhere into the night--had it been
in the bathroom when he was vomiting or when he was back under the
net with a washcloth on his head?--he could not place where&#160;
he was at; and then odd thoughts came into his mind. "If love oils
are a way to make the anus and the vagina something that they
aren't designed for maybe I'm pregnant with my brother's
child?&#160; Does he love me?&#160; What is love?&#160; My bottom
has spread out like a damp shirt when stretched"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Then it was the mosquito again.&#160;
He asked what were Jatupon's job aspirations in Bangkok. "Oh, I
don't know," the boy responded. "I have thought many things."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Such as&#8230;&#8221; it asked.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "At times I have thought that I could
become a monk--one of those real monks that live in the cave, eat
only vegetables, and have no needs or wants."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The mosquito scoffed.&#160; "What a
bloody idealist.&#160; Deny your hungers and you deny the animal
that comprises so much of the human being&#8212;the animal that
developed a high degree of consciousness to fight his way up as the
dominant specie, the animal that nonetheless behaves according to
instinct.&#160; If you deny the human you will have wasted your
life not living it at all.&#160; That is what will happen if you
are lucky.&#160; If unlucky, I suppose you will eventually snap
like a crazed immigration officer who begins to shoot
tourists.&#160; You are an animal not that you have to be swallowed
up whole into your hungers.&#160; The illusions of being in love,
the ambitions that have allowed you to subdue the Earth under the
illusion of gaining some happy plateau after making your conquests,
are not hardly instincts one can extract.&#160; One shouldn&#8217;t
extract them. These instincts have filled your kind with purpose
thereby making brief existences on a meaningless planet bearable.
Most importantly sexual desire keeps your race proliferating. Tell
me something a bit more practical."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Well...sometimes I have thought I
could become a money collector in a city bus. I would be a Bangkok
Metropolitan Transportation employee--BMT."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Well, being prime minister would never
suit you.&#160; I must say that this is certainly less extreme and
easily in your reach.&#160; What attracts you to the profession of
ticket tearing?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jatupon imagined the money collector
clicking the lid of his metallic cylinder while shoving through the
people. At times he would sit on the monkey bar near the open door
feeling the artificial winds created by this fast moving green tube
full of standing contortionists.&#160; When new customers came in
he would put their money into the tube and extract tickets,
weightless as stamps, from the same container. He would click and
click to get their attention. When the bus was inordinately full,
barefoot or in sandals, he would stand on the last step an inch
from death like a parachutist without a parachute.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I just think that I could do it," he
told the mosquito.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Yes," said the mosquito, "but could
you count change to the satisfaction of the mass transit department
of Bangkok?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I'm not hardly a dummy," Jatupon said
angrily.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Let&#8217;s not go into that,&#8221;
the mosquito said.&#160; &#8220;I know you can count.&#160;
I&#8217;m just not sure if it goes beyond ten.&#160; That&#8217;s
all.&#160; What other fun things could you become if
needed&#8212;any type of job that can at least grant you eighty
dollars worth of free falling baht each month?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I don't know.&#160; I'm tired of
thinking about it.&#160; It is such an anguish to worry about
surviving continually."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Indeed.&#160; Just like you were
thinking before: animals that have insight into the fact that they
are nothing but ambulatory meat; only you are the meat of the
richer classes.&#160; Your life will be consumed at work for their
pleasure."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The girl friend handed her sun burnt
Siamese a key to the room and excoriated him for not believing her
about the distance of the apartment building from the department
store.&#160; She snubbed encountering extensive numbers of the
underclass even&#160; though her father owned the building.&#160;
She stood aloof and contracted the muscles of her face even before
the evaporation of urinary molecules from the fa&#231;ade of the
building attacked her nostrils. She disheveled Jatupon&#8217;s hair
and then maternally combed it back again with her fingers.&#160;
She told Kumpee that she would take a taxi back to the department
store and wait for him at McDonald&#8217;s. Then she left them in
repugnance.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; Within a glance each of them saw all there
was of their apartment burrowed under the building and became
sullen. Kumpee lied that he would leave his bag in the apartment
and then see his girlfriend back to her home.&#160; Jatupon lay on
the floor. Suthep unpacked and put the headphones of a Walkman
around his ears.&#160; Kazem took a shower.&#160; The subject of
his departure was forgotten.&#160; Kumpee sat on his case for a
half hour eating his durian.&#160; Then when there seemed an
inconspicuous exit he picked up his bag and went away.&#160; They
felt his missing presence prod the vacuous air an hour later when
they noticed that the suitcase was gone.</p>

Chapter 4</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It was 2 a.m. and the mosquito came
into the scenes of his REM with wings piercing through and
dominating over every brief episodic nightmare. It was wearing an
orange monk's robe and superciliously imposed its own presence on
all scenes that Jatupon alone was supposed to rehearse.&#160; It
altered a script that Jatupon's brain had conjured in the hope of
figuring out how to interact with his environment and live with
himself harmoniously.&#160; Initially his sleep consisted of
nascent dream-roles to find out if feigning a serious illness would
have altered his parents' journey of early demise.&#160; Later
there were others such as trying to persuade the fetid one's
Chinese girlfriend to buy him a white shirt and necktie so that he
could apply at the Bangkok Metropolitan Transportation Department
and thereby resurrect himself as an economic deliverer and a
masculine force to be admired instead of dog excrement on his
brothers' heels that he perceived them as perceiving him to
be.&#160; There were also briefer skits in the random feelings,
thoughts, and perceptions he was trying to categorize.&#160; One
was of trying to successfully bite his shirt to stop himself from
crying out when Kazem's riveting night sports were too painful and
another one was of attempting to remember the few neighborhoods and
streets of Bangkok that he had learnt in past visits and perhaps
link them to various names that only sleep could recall.&#160;
Throughout it all was the buzz of the mosquito.&#160; This
insect-monk buzzed no differently than a bee.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;And where were you today and
yesterday?&#8221; it asked.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t get out the glue
and there were no pills to pop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you get out the
glue?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I want to do this for fun.&#160;
I want these trips to stay what they call
&#8220;recreational.&#8221;&#160; I&#8217;ll take them only when I
need out.&#160; I don&#8217;t want to be an addict.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You aren&#8217;t an addict.&#160; If
your body really wanted it, you wouldn&#8217;t have been able to
resist it for over 24 hours.&#160; Still, even though this is noble
and good, you don&#8217;t want to walk away from your
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;What did you do this
afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I went to fly a kite near Wat
Phra Kaeo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Do you mean you masturbated in
the temple housing the Emerald Buddha?&#160; I mean that&#8217;s
fine if it is true.&#160; Surely another person or two over the
past two or three centuries has done that also.&#160; All the same,
please refrain from using Thai slang.&#160; You don&#8217;t want to
sound like a dummy when you talk to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No, I mean it literally,
Ajarn,&#8221; said Jatupon.&#160; Ajarn meant &#8220;respected
teacher.&#8221;&#160; &#8220;I went to the area outside of the
Grand Palace in Sanam Luang.&#160; In front of the golden and
pointed domes of the entrance there is an oval football field of
dirt.&#160; The radio mentioned that hundreds of boys and girls
were flying kites there.&#160; I was planning to buy a kite and fly
mine with the hundreds that were soaring next to each other but
there was no one my age doing that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Neither a boy nor a man: what an
awkward state to be in.&#160; Anyhow, so you wanted to fly a kite
near the golden pagodas and cupolas of the Grand Palace and Wat
Phra Kaeo but you didn&#8217;t do so.&#160; I assume it was more
for lack of money.&#160; Is that right?&#160; Is that
all?&#160;&#160; I can&#8217;t imagine why you would think that you
could use money for such extravagances considering your present
predicament.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I had some.&#160; I always get
some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I go through Kazem&#8217;s
pockets when he is asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Do you mean you steal
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Not really.&#160; He knows
I do it.&#160; It is kind of like a little game&#8230;sort
of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Oh, I can pick it from
your simple mind so easily. The rule being that after you provide
your sexual services to him he allows you to pickpocket from the
pants that he drapes on a chair.&#160; If he awakens he beats you
or disparages your existence in front of the family but if you are
quiet you can take most of what he has in his pockets and run away
throughout the day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;When I&#8217;m not working. That
is kind of how it has gone. He has always been kind enough to see
that I get a vacation every week.&#160; He was always telling
Mother that I needed to be something other than an illiterate slob
and the least they could do was allow me to go to the library once
a week. I would usually go there&#8230;sometimes a movie or
standing at a newsstand reading the comics.&#160; That is sort of
how it was.&#160; Now we aren&#8217;t working so I didn&#8217;t
take very much yesterday.&#160; Hey, if you can read my simple
little mind so easily, why do you bother to ask things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;To amuse myself a little.&#160;
Did this pickpocket game occur when your parents were
alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes, it began when I was eleven.&#160;
What could I have said to anyone?&#160; I was hated.&#160; You said
so yourself.&#160; I wasn&#8217;t going to make it worse by
humiliating myself that way.&#160; They wouldn&#8217;t have
believed me; and they wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to think about
something so disgusting. Anyhow, Kazem always had me swear that
I&#8217;d keep it secret and he is the only one who has really
cared about me&#8212;as much as people care about others. Maybe not
so much.&#8221;&#160; He became taciturn.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Quiet!&#8221; said the mosquito
belatedly.&#160; &#8220;I hear something.&#8221;&#160; It paused
and looked through the small window of the basement
apartment.&#160; &#8220;Oh, it is your mother driving up
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t drive.&#160;
She doesn&#8217;t own a car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;She does now.&#8221;&#160;
Jatupon remembered that she always did buy lottery tickets that
mendicants sold from wooden attach&#233; cases hung around their
chests.&#160; &#8220;I thought she didn&#8217;t have the chance of
a snowball in hell of winning&#8221; commented the mosquito.&#160;
&#8220;Anyhow, here she is and it is grocery day.&#160; You need to
help her bring in the bags.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It was raining but he nonetheless heard
the car. He sauntered out of the kitchen of the river cabin as the
screen door sprang back behind him.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Mother," he yelled in a surprised
tone.&#160; "You're back."&#160; The engine stopped.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Of course I&#8217;m here.&#160;
You knew I&#8217;d be back in an hour.&#160; Where else would I
be?&#8221;&#160; Her voice screamed out belligerently but it was
hollow and virtually inaudible in the container of the car. The
Mercedes Benz was flaxen and waxed and the woman inside was a bit
of the same self in an idealized way.&#160; She was even more
young, beautiful and poised than Kumpee&#8217;s girlfriend.&#160;
Her skin was also whiter than the fetid one's infatuation and
instead of being dark, thick, and puffy like a durable and well
tread tire she was a thin sheath, almost like a transparent condom,
and perfectly
unblemished.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Did you go to
Ayutthaya?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Have you really forgotten where
I&#8217;ve been.&#160; Even you can&#8217;t be that stupid.&#160; I
told you before I left.&#160; I went to Thee Nhai." Thee nai was
the word "Where" in Thai; but she spoke it with such certainty that
he believed in its legitimacy as a city name like Changmai. She
spoke even more loudly from her encasement inside the car but was
still barely audible.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "To see Grandmother?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "And grocery shopping.&#160; After all,
it is grocery day. &#8220;&#160; She stopped frowning and slowly
made a partial smile. &#8220;I have something for you." He felt
surprised. He wondered why he would be given something. He
couldn&#8217;t remember having ever been given a gift.&#160; In
Thailand (the real Thailand as lived by the poor masses) children
were instruments: tools to ease the task of making a living, and
later they were sustenance and emotional pampering for the aging
parents. Above the steering wheel she showed to him a small
rectangular box that she opened like a coffin.&#160; In it was a
large golden pen that gleamed like the roofs of a Buddhist temple.
Minutes passed.&#160; She continued to exhibit the pen and her
half-smile while staying encased. All of the car windows were
rolled up. He kept wondering what good the pen would do him if it
were just a visual appearance seen through the glass of a
car.&#160; He forgot the pen and concentrated on his mother who was
as intangible.&#160; He heard the sound of her calmly wrestling
unsuccessfully with a door handle that would not unlock.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He or it--this mordant mosquito-- came
with wings piercing through sleep.&#160; He again spoke of her, the
girlfriend, as "Chinatown skin" and drawing her from a deck of
cards, the mosquito threw her. The card, animated like an email
greeting, clicked around as if on high heels.&#160; The woman's
form, detaching itself from the shell of the card, sang and danced
her dance. Jatupon and the mosquito both lusted for her. Jatupon
wanted to rush into the toilet the way he had seen a man in his
early twenties rush into the public restroom at the movie theatre,
Major Ciniplex in Ayuttaya, a week before his parents died. On that
occasion, or misadventure, Jatupon, who a minute later went to
relieve himself in an adjacent cubicle before going back to his
cart of noodles, heard pumping noises. Then on his side of the
crack he faintly saw a shadow of a hand stroking a penis on the
tiles to the left of his feet.&#160; That man had sought pleasure
in marginal solitude; but for him, with a mosquito staring him down
with emotionless black eyes, there was no privacy. His masturbatory
time was limited by his hallucinations.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He tried to suffocate the thought of
the Chinese Thai woman in an imaginary pillowcase.&#160; He tried
to extinguish the sparks of his own desires by deluging them with
more abstract and tenuous thoughts.&#160; He wondered what would be
some other choices of jobs he could pursue to break away from what
was left of this fraternity and become an independent being.&#160;
The idea hurt him.&#160; He then told himself that he never wanted
to leave his brothers.&#160; He told himself that he would go out
to find Kumpee, the fetid one, if he only knew where in the big
city to search.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jatupon saw his own pimpled face
staring at him; his childhood friends who moved or became people he
could not relate to; and his parents that no human sense of
bonding, volition, or imagination could bring back. Orphic memories
gleamed and sparkled opaquely like the moving shadows of leaves on
the pavement. "So, I can not see my own reflection without
cringing.&#160; So, I felt that sense of fear that came from
thinking that my classmates might not want me to play tucraw with
me and that feeling has not left me entirely.&#160; So, I'm scared
of losing people, like fumbling with the bamboo ball, as if their
departure would be the end of my own personal essence!&#160; So, in
the end, we all come down in a cruel fate." He could not formulate
these abstract thoughts.&#160; It all was a base and indistinct
feeling.&#160; He was attempting to channel the fears that
constituted so much of his being so that they would not burst into
his consciousness.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "So, have you finished falling so fully
and foolishly into yourself," asked the mosquito.&#160; It paused
and looked back at the girl.&#160; "She is Chinatown skin, the kind
every man pants for: all beautifully white, each aesthetic
non-deformity ranking her in the realm of desirability in every
Thai man's mind.&#160; 'Won't she, in this quintessence of beauty,
have virtually no chance of making a deformed baby,' screams the
man's ingrained DNA programming that composes each and every
cell.&#160; &#8216;Won&#8217;t she, in this quintessence of beauty,
have virtually no chance of making a deformed baby,&#8217;
scream&#8217;s the psychological programming created by the
influence of his peers who think that her money and education have
made her as valuable as white ivory &#8211;the type often used in
Buddhist statuettes.&#160;&#160; Hormonal discriminatory passions
ensue, dopamine hits the pleasure receptors of the brain, and make
him an addict for a hormonal pleasure with her."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Is this love?&#160; Is this all that
we are?&#160; Love is the best part of us and yet it is as
this?&#160; I can't believe that," retorted Jatupon.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The mosquito, the big "it," guffawed.
"You are truly ingenuous.&#160; You are contrary to the natural
world around you&#8212;a true babe focusing your trusting round
eyes so eagerly on the savage world around you.&#160; Personally it
is a novelty to me and I don&#8217;t mind it at all. Do you
remember how you felt when you were young?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He remembered the warmth he felt toward
his mother even though she did not like him. He remembered how she
cared for him despite thinking him a burden.&#160; She was the good
birdy feeding his mouth.&#160; Had he not believed all love to be
something like a mother's love and that this mother's love was
pure?&#160;&#160; Had he as little as a few days earlier been
inveigled in the optimism of being free from the consideration of
how instinct is passed down in genetic transfer from generation to
generation?&#160; Had he not imagined a desire for a woman and
being "in love" as something more spectacular than bottle rockets
and Roman candles lit from the bridges over the Chao Phraya River
in the Loi krathong celebration?&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; There were times he had even considered
love to be a preordained gift bestowed onto each being in subtle
and illuminating graces.&#160; It was a bit like a lit candle on a
krathong, a hand length banana-leaf boat sent out onto waters
during the Loi krathong holiday.&#160; A given krathong would
perhaps sail a hundred meters on a river before being tipped over
in waves and winds along with one&#8217;s negativity and
culpability; and for this exorcism the river goddess would bestow
onto such an individual a new year of blessings.&#160; As a boy he
had thought that this universal love was so pure that it was
colorless and translucent.&#160; He believed that it was so
ubiquitous and protecting like a mosquito net around the world, but
alive, sensitive, and full of feeling; and that from it came the
babies...the babies.&#160; Certainly as the years were placed on
the tables like plates of rice and bowls of noodle soup it was
harder to believe that brotherly love was equally dispersed among
mankind. It seemed that the darker the pigment of a Thai, the more
likely he was to do his menial tasks and the whiter he was, the
more such Thais seemed to own the enterprises of the country.&#160;
To his brother, Kumpee, like the father, he had existed as a verbal
punching bag to relieve stress. "Night sports" was the term that
Kazem called his form of brotherly love.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Now..." scoffed the mosquito as it
smiled maliciously, "Now, you know the truth.&#160; The truth shall
set you free.&#160; Babies come from the desire to both eat healthy
human flesh and crawl and slither around in its beautiful
skin."&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He woke up startled to a void and a
room that was at first unfamiliar in the darkness until memory
seeped in and he knew where he was at.&#160; As he was feeling
depressed looking at this basement room where they were caged and
smelling the stagnancy of air stinking of mens&#8217; bodies more
eclectically than just their armpits, he fought with the
rectangular window to which leaned weeds and grass.&#160; He barely
budged it open.&#160; The patch of greenery flushed its grassy
smells as well as the urinary ones with a gust of wind. Even decay
was in the grass and such smells were beautiful.&#160; He watched
the blades moving.&#160; They whispered of impermanence.&#160; They
reminded him that as dictators die, civilizations ultimately become
nothing but a few buried artifacts and bones, and palaces crumble,
he would not stay in this cell forever.&#160; Everything would
change; and change at times had its advantage.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And yet the child in him resisted
change.&#160; It yearned to declare every dust particle that had
been trodden on its friend.&#160; It did not like parting and it,
in him, hated the idea of Kumpee gone.&#160; He felt jealous that
this woman had taken him. He hated her despite her earlier
friendliness to him.&#160; He hated her white skin and hated Kumpee
for his ugly dark skin, his abandonment, and his fetid ways.&#160;
Mostly he hated his contemptuously tinged use of the nickname,
&#8220;Jatuporn,&#8221; showing that he knew everything about this
relationship with Kazem.&#160;&#160; The apathy in the
pronouncement would have been bearable.&#160; The contempt would
have at least shown concern.&#160; But that particular mix spelled
out that he, Jatupon, was really the fetid one and he hated the
fetid one for it.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Stagnant and morose in feelings and
thoughts, he dripped in the sauna of his own sweat; and, careful
not to stumble over his brothers in the night, he opened the door
for more breezes, for a passing mosquito, for voices, and the
dispersing of crowded thoughts.&#160; He recalled untainted and
simple memories of Kazem telling Suthep a joke a customer had
relayed to him making all four of them laugh until they turned red;
the shapes and slight variations of the colors of clouds; and lying
on his bed in their parents home hearing the sounds of locusts
somewhere in the swaying tree limbs cradled in the wind&#8217;s
caresses.&#160; He knew that such trivial and yet poetical
experiences were what constituted human happiness.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He stepped outside and then walked a
couple of blocks in a still relatively unfamiliar terrain. To him,
the surveyor of the night, the city spilled out in the oozing
newness of black and yellow tubes of paint. There was a larger road
and across the street was a Seven-Eleven convenience store.&#160;
He stood there and his eyes followed the traffic that went directly
in front of it. He rummaged through one of his bags until he found
his glue.&#160; He inhaled its fumes and popped some amphetamines
he had purchased at the drugstore with Kazem&#8217;s pocket
money.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He remembered that Suthep and Kazem,
like curious beasts, had occasionally looked in on him during that
time, a year ago, when his body had its opiate force (really a
mixed drug combination adversely affected by beer he drank during
the Songkran New Year&#8217;s water fight) poured from it like
water from a colander.&#160; How sick he had been. From
Kazem&#8217;s suggestion, it had been a monk--a former teacher of
his boyhood-- whom he had stayed with while he was stiff and
shaking. The periodic vomiting and shaking had seemed so incessant
although it, like all, was fleeting. It had been too intolerable
for his parents and yet for all the talk of the father getting rid
of him completely by shoving him into a monastery, they had been
happy to again gain their worker.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; Lost in the myriad dimly lit trails of his
own thoughts, he at last returned and went back to his bed of
clothes.&#160; He smoothed them out. He made them even.&#160; He
thought that he might be reprimanded about leaving the door open
for insects to fly in.&#160; It was to his satisfaction but it
probably wouldn&#8217;t be to theirs and these brothers might
easily awaken from the dogs that could be heard a block away.&#160;
He got up and shut both the door and the window. Then, for a few
minutes, he listened to the howling of dogs muffled through the
closed door.&#160; For a half hour his positions changed restlessly
on the wad of clothes. He thought of the postcard pictures of
temples and palaces; of possibly being a money collector on the
city busses, standing on a step and hanging out of the continually
opened door of a green bus; of--</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "What a pathetic existence.&#160; You
haven&#8217;t even paid any rent on this room. Gifts can be taken
back, you know. You could be thrown out at any whim: Kazem&#8217;s,
the girlfriend&#8217;s, her father who might hate him enough to
kick you out.&#160; You have no money or jobs.&#160; What will you
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I thought that you weren't coming
here."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Here?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "To Bangkok."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Did I say that?" it asked for the
first time in a tone that was introspective and self-conscious.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; "You said it.&#160; If you make yourself out
to be this monster of truths I can't see how you can lie like
this."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I was with you earlier in a less
bright, more murky form of a dream when you were anxious that you
hadn&#8217;t gotten any privacy to fly your kite.&#160; You
didn&#8217;t seem to remember quoting me then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160; It did not like the merit of its own veracity
scrutinized.&#160; It turned away and paused.&#160; It scratched
one leg against another thoughtfully the way one might a
scalp.&#160; Jatupon wondered for a moment if the insect would
disappear wordlessly from the weight of it's own waning confidence
but there was no chance of that. It reasserted itself, attempting
to discard its solemn self-interrogations for a more august posture
and attitude.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "You would be the aimless kinetic
movements of other dust just like your kind if it wasn&#8217;t for
me giving you consciousness and a soul.&#160; You impudent little
dummy, you should not speak to your ajarn this way.&#160; Your
blood only has worth as the nutrients of my posterity.&#160; That
is its purpose.&#160; If you become so calculating and crafty with
me I&#8217;ll reevaluate our relationship.&#8221;&#160; One of its
arms reached over and caressed his skin.&#160; &#8220;At a
distance,&#8221; it said, &#8220;the brownness makes it look as
solid as a rock.&#160; I forget that it is so tender.&#160; Your
naivety also seems so obdurate that I often forget the self-serving
and disingenuous muck underneath it all.&#8221;&#160; It brought
back its arm, opened its mouth widely, and spat at the
boy.&#160;&#160; &#8220;Here have an early Songkran,&#8221; it
said.&#160; Songkran was the New Year&#8217;s water festival in the
hottest month of April.&#160;&#160; The month was really March of
the year 2445 according to the Thai Buddhist calendar. &#8220;I
come and go by the dictates of my own intelligent, restless
brooding.&#160; I move from one rock to another hoping to get
satisfaction or at least a reprieve from dissatisfaction.&#160; I,
an intelligent being, must delude myself that the composite of
rocks that make up this planet are something other than hardened
shells of dirt and that I, wandering from one rock to another, am
really living experiences instead of hallucinating pleasurable
sensations for my self to stay sane.&#160; Only seeing other life
forms scrambling around the rocks to be my appetizers engender me
with purpose.&#160; It paused.&#160; "There is nothing too peculiar
in me wandering around in contradictory paths. All intelligent
creatures are the same. Boredom drives them to reshape their
environment to serve their petty and selfish goals. This might be
entertaining for higher creatures but it&#8217;s an absolute curse
for the highest."&#160; It wiggled its face and then pointed with
an arm.&#160; "I must relieve your mind of worry.&#160; As they
say, ignorance is bliss. You have little risk of finding boredom so
insanely strong even if you stay bound to noodles all your
life.&#160; Boredom makes me curious. I want to know many
things.&#160; I want to know about you boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You are a bit like our guardian,
aren&#8217;t you..&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes, if that is what you need--
a surrogate uncle: that is what I&#8217;ll
be.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; His vision, his mosquito-uncle and deus
ex machina, smashed like a fly against a car window.&#160; Jatupon
was exhausted and his mental alertness relaxed in preparation for
sleep. In a REM more troubled, incoherent, and weltering, there
were flies seemingly caught between a window and a screen. The
screen was opened a crack and yet the crack only demarcated freedom
and the self-imprisonment of the mind for they climbed around the
screen and yet never found that opening that had allowed them to
enter.&#160; Then there were rocks with a bit of honey and flies
swarming in it; and himself echoing the mosquito&#8217;s question
on how the three of them would be making a living.&#160; He
disparaged himself by casting that self as a cartoon of a
motorcycle taxi driver sitting sidesaddle with a group waiting
patiently in a queue for customers to arrive.&#160; Stationary with
time passing amuck, and content with empty and drowsy space and
flies buzzing about his face, his life defied money and
motion.&#160;&#160; &#8220;Get out of the way.&#160; If you
can&#8217;t fasten a doorknob take a broom and sweep up that mess
in the back of the restaurant.&#160; I don&#8217;t know what you
are going to do when you get older.&#160; You can&#8217;t even
cook.&#160; You can&#8217;t do anything and even walking you trip
over your own shadow,&#8221; said his father. &#8220;You should see
his cartoons,&#8221; said Kazem.&#160; &#8220;The boy can
draw.&#8221; The cartoon of himself had signed the wedding papers
and he and his cartoon wife were standing near a monk as relatives
came by with bowls of water rinsing their hands.&#160; Flies buzzed
around their faces.&#160; A worker, selling Buddhist statuettes,
necklaces, and rosaries, picked her child up, pulled down his
pants, and let him urinate in the parking lot.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Love," said the cartoon of the
mosquito, "makes up the vernacular of pop culture.&#160; It is
innate as a quest.&#160; It lances life's old festers granting a
mood of the new.&#160; For the male it is a consistent alternative
on nights when the hunt for new females becomes unsuccessful. Both
sexes need to believe that their own physical attributes will be
passed on to posterity. For sociable creatures the illusion of
having a permanent foundation for their lives in marriage and
family is indispensable. So much goes into this ineluctable lure
called love and marriage: most of all a void so enormous that we
chip through other skulls to record the memory of ourselves in that
watery mass called a brain. On overpasses and sidewalks you've
noticed those weak starving dogs with patches of fur missing from
their bodies. They too sniff around other dogs in the hope of
confirming and making some permanent documentation of themselves on
those brains.&#160; Even if they don&#8217;t have energy for sex
they still document themselves. Men are programmed to deliver the
raw material of themselves in any dark alley.&#160; A woman&#8217;s
love, once devoted to he who has pierced into her&#8212;he who has
engendered in her that overpowering feeling of one inside her-- now
devotes herself to motherhood and seeing that the child
is&#8230;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; His ideas were erratic.&#160; They
hopped and skipped over each other and he held tightly onto parts
of the clothing he lay on.&#160; Then with photographic images, he
dreamed of trees, waterfalls, and Thai islands he had never seen
before and his hands relaxed their grip on the clothes.&#160;&#160;
There was a panoramic view of Thailand&#8212;rural, Khmer and
Burmese individuals smiling in the northern regions and stolid
Moslem and Indians in the south.&#160; The rural views in sunrise
and sunset were more real than reality and then the aerial focus
went down and down and veered back up to the center.&#160; It was
Bangkok again and there was Lumpini Park.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; An unknown girl was sitting on a
mat in the gravel in a far corner of the entrance to the
park.&#160; Immediately behind her was the gate and in front of her
was a large statue of King Rama V.&#160;&#160; A car entered the
circular drive that went around the statue.&#160; She got up to
guide its driver where to park. She hoped that by helping to ensure
that he didn&#8217;t crash into parked cars that he would pay her a
few baht as others had.&#160; She did not beg.&#160; She did not
prostitute herself. She only did that.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I could do something like
that.&#160; It&#8217;s honest,&#8221; thought
Jatupon.&#160;&#160;&#160; She continued to use hand gestures as
the driver backed up according to her directions.&#160; &#8220;This
is a good girl.&#160; I want someone like that to become my
wife,&#8221; he thought.&#160;&#160; No sooner had this idea come
to him than the car sped up and ran over her. Then it stopped and
the driver hurried out. The driver held her in his hands and
Jatupon felt her pulse.&#160; There was none and he dropped the
arm.&#160; He walked through the gate to a woman sitting within the
park on a sheet on top of a grassy knoll.&#160; He sat on the sheet
in front of her and before the spread of fortune telling
cards.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t see much future in
it&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;Being in love with an elder
brother.&#160; There is no future in it from what I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Those are just cards.&#160; How
would you know?&#8221; he whined</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes, those are just cards but
you don&#8217;t even need to look into the cards to see something
like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;How should I live?&#160;
He&#8217;s had sex in me.&#160; I should kill myself.&#160; A boy
fucked in the ass can not be a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No, probably not; but you must
continue to be the best of what you are.&#160; Man, yes,
some&#8212;a few-- might say.&#160; Some would say something less
than that.&#160; Whatever you are, maimed or full, you have to
continue to continue.&#160; We all should go through the whole show
until the winds carry away our ashes and the soul returns for more
learning, more suffering.&#8221;</p>

Chapter 5</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Bound for his uncle&#8217;s home in the
far north of the city, Kazem was forced to reposition himself in
the back of the bus next to a bucket of swishing water and
rags.&#160; He swatted the mosquito that was hovering over its
sodden progeny.&#160; He beat it towards the baldheads of a couple
of monks in front of him who had usurped his seat impudently. From
his new and more uncomfortable seat, which often lost its cushion
as he sat there, he looked out of the window and tried to beat back
the inferno of hate for Kumpee that flared in the nerves throughout
his body. He stared down at what appeared as the moving edge of the
road from which businesses and pedestrians, from the corner of his
left eye, ricocheted.&#160; He fingered a slit of the vinyl blue
upholstery of his cushion in a vaginal preoccupation passed onto
males through the inheritance of this cellular knowledge called
sexual instinct.&#160; Low levels of guilt oozed from him more
subtlly than foaming breakers of beer in a mug and yet he
didn&#8217;t feel that he had done anything wrong.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This moment was no different than other
times of malaise in the past. He wasn&#8217;t specifically troubled
about the fruition of his wanton fantasies to meet his uncle in the
hope of using him for some money.&#160; Money should never
rest.&#160; It should be spent or invested.&#160; If it were
invested it would be used to make more wealth or for philanthropy
that ameliorated thievery.&#160; He agreed in a vague way with
Kumpee who vaguely inveighed something to the effect that a bit of
money from a more affluent pocket into a poorer one helped the
economy and was a just act.&#160; Likewise, he was not bothered by
the release he had gained earlier in a bit of sex with his youngest
sibling.&#160; This activity was to him just an extension of a back
rub in a good massage compounded in a bit of sportily
wrestling.&#160; It was a due owed to him for undergoing the stress
of looking after the younger brothers and keeping the principle of
family alive. He was acting his part of the big brother no
different than he always had since Kumpee was continually negligent
in performing the role. There were no specifics to this malaise he
felt. The malaise was brought on by the wistful craving to go
beyond the confines of his containment and yet reality, petty and
limited, told him to use what was there under his feet, in his
sight, and what he could touch. A man in the confines of his life
used what was under him.&#160; What being did not use the
Earth?</p>

<pre>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He continued to finger the slit of the vinyl blue upholstery in a vaginal preoccupation. He wanted to feel beyond the hole of malaise that was as empty as the hollow whistling of a wind through a cracked door or that numb sensation of lying alone, the fantasy of his masturbation eluding him, and his semen flowing on his skin in a last vestige of a river. Using others was as unconscious as a reflex but the malaise came into the equation when he saw what he had to use.&#160; Why didn&#8217;t he have money to wine and dine a female in the mating protocol like any male black-tipped hang fly?&#160; Why did he have to cajole, beg, or charm an avuncular affection from this remote individual who wasn&#8217;t related to them by blood?
</pre>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He began to stare at the driver and a
boy who sat near the front window in a padded hump that went over
the gearshift.&#160; It was just like seeing a self in miniature
that had gotten lost and ensnared in the thickets of time: father
driving the bus and this boy seated on a padded metal covering that
went over the transmission.&#160; At times the boy touched the
clutch hoping to one day guide the mammoth beast like his father
(the boy believing that his father was the perfection of all things
possible). A plastic red container of ice and water was on this
pedestal where the boy sat and from it a straw stuck out of the lid
and he drank and ate fish chips that were in a plastic sack.&#160;
He just ate and drank as the bus circled around its route of the
city.&#160; How drab it all was but for a boy and yet believing his
father to be the perfection of all things, such self-restraint was
possible.&#160; Their father had had such a job when Kumpee was a
young boy.&#160; For a year or two of such journeys, sitting there
with the highest admiration for a father, he was filled with the
highest love that was initiating him into the positive dimensions
of manhood and responsibility.&#160; When his father lost his job
and worked on the street alongside of their mother, he launched his
tirades against the younger brothers who were
&#8220;suck-calves&#8221; on his wife.&#160; He hated their
neediness and as the spankings continued, Kumpee began to oppose
these gestures.&#160; Such self-abnegation caused him to become the
full brunt of the beatings.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Having been given time alone, Jatupon
scraped up his stolen collection of loose change and ran off hand
in hand with his freedom.&#160; Having no responsibilities for the
first time in his life apart from the night sports that usually
happened in the mornings, his life was becoming a purposeless
abyss.&#160; He personified his freedom and together they broke
beyond small basement windows and imagined portals to real
places.&#160; Together, they went to see the life that fulminated
within the streets of the city of Bangkok.&#160; Kazem was gone so
they did not have to be there to hear his expletives about the
older brother&#8217;s thievery and the younger brother&#8217;s
disappearances.&#160; The disappearances were ones Kazem attributed
to Suthep chumming up with Kumpee to have a bit of money to play
snookers. For hours and hours they were lost in the movements of
traffic, the brown and Chinese faces, movements of strangers on the
sidewalks, and the swirl of infinite numbers on the quest for
money, happiness, and adventure.&#160; He read faces and movements
from his spreading feelers. They too wanted money bestowed onto
them to squander at will in all forms of self-indulgence.&#160;
They too wanted to squelch their routines to live their
dishonorable lives in the quest of sensuality.&#160; To have
resources and freedom to run around loose as a goose in a
department store was something they all yearned for and seeing
these pedestrian shoppers of the sidewalk, with more money than he,
made the boy hunger for better things.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Freedom was becoming old as he
continued to walk with her into the crowds but she rejuvenated
lasciviously when his eye spotted someone not in the
shopper&#8217;s swirl. The cravings so attractive to Jatupon were
missing in those deadened eyes and passing from him he fell into
the others. Membership was free.&#160; It was lack of hope that was
given so generously to the majority of the world's populace that
was indispensable to them.&#160; Lurid as family, fetid as Kumpee's
shoes, here they were and here he was with them; and yet they were
his own or what he assumed was his own--the little that he knew of
himself.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It was a family of addicts, addicted to
family or even a concoction of family, cobbled together within the
affinity of pain and the tangles of neurons like brambles pricking
their consciousness with old travail at every turn: memories that
they couldn't free themselves from.&#160; Within this desert of
cacti and brambles they poured destructive chemicals and suicidal
inclinations to kill and enlarge their brambly world. They were
landscape artists of their personal deserts: hating, destroying,
and replanting their cacti and brambles with each new whim. Here he
was with a new family--a mosaic of complete strangers who were not
related to him nor were they relating to him or much to each
other.&#160; Still, it was a surrogate family nonetheless
succumbing to an infinite current of darkness to which they all had
understanding.&#160; In many ways they were wiser: they knew that
the insatiability of desire that made one propelled to breed, work,
and buy was not going to stop.&#160; They knew that no one in such
circles was going to find contentment.&#160; They were all going to
fail miserably. They knew that there was a deep discontent in the
human psyche that yearned for destruction and death. In the course
of being degraded by significant others they had somehow gotten
excluded from the participation of such narcissistic, consumeristic
appetites and that the salvation of compassion would not be
forthcoming.&#160; This benign pastel family sat together on the
slab of cement under the overpass while over them, on the overpass
itself, were the trinkets sold by salesmen, homeless elderly women,
mothers, those who stunk from being unable to bathe off their
rotting surface of scaling skin, and deformed slabs of flesh spread
out on parts of the overpass with fidgeting partial limbs. They all
had nearly empty cups of one baht coins and the most unfortunate of
them could testify of dark currents deeper than regular people
could imagine for one moment.&#160; They, his surrogate family,
knew that there was not just one blackness but despair had myriad
blacker and bleaker hues.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under the steps of the overpass
sniffing his glue while these transients already riddled in
amphetamines and alcohol (at times borrowing his glue) smoked
cigarettes incessantly, his mind swept away from him like a
butterfly fluttering by.&#160; When he first met them in this spot
their first words were to offer to him cigarettes but he told them
that if he were to put one in his mouth it would remind him of the
fetid one with his fetid shoes and socks littered everywhere, the
one who had stolen his parents property upon their deaths and had
abandoned them to starvation in the great city of Bangkok.&#160;
These transients had the understanding and listening skills of
trained psychologists and offered unto him a piece of bubble gum
instead which he gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Still, a thought preoccupied him off
and on. He wondered why they were all seated there in such a
confined space; but within a few hours the storm clouds moved
overhead and the rain deluged the streets making him forget about
one man complaining of his jock itch and scratching himself,
another that cried and looked up into the clouds, and a third that
kept wanting to barter off his torn sandals for Jatupon&#8217;s
sneakers and kept calling him &#8220;uncle&#8221; even though he
was ten or fifteen years the older brother.&#160; Across the road
he occasionally saw umbrellas sail out to the gray of the
clouds.&#160; One of the other five transients was repulsed by a
spider that crept onto him in its effort to escape the rain, cursed
at a rock in his shoe that would not leave the obscure crevice of
the sole, and then in one of his shifting moods made a declaration
of happiness that they had found such an inconspicuous spot where
the police rarely harassed them.&#160; The woman transient gave
herself to her man so completely that when he was angry, happy, or
sad, she was more this way--so little did she understand her own
mind, having become nothing but an extension of his pleasure and
pain.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Sometimes silent and tacit, these
transients who were continually judged by others, judged the
sincerity of his callow rebellion with their stares.&#160; A few
times they went beyond that to a more pronounced judgment.&#160;
"Don't you have a mamma to go to?&#160; Your mamma's calling for
you to come to lunch,&#8221; said the one with the woman.&#160;
That time the shoe barterer laughed so hard it churned up mucus
into his mouth, which he spit into a crack in the sidewalk that
already had its share of gum and cigarette buds.&#160; "Mamma's
calling," said the woman.&#160; "Lunch is ready, honey. Mamma's
calling," she repeated or at least he thought she repeated.&#160;
Maybe none of them had said anything.&#160; He wasn't quite
sure.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jatupon turned away from them and
slipped off his tennis shoes, smelling their soles to make sure
that they weren&#8217;t overly fetid.&#160; He looked at one of his
bare feet composed of roadways of veins and early wrinkles of
epidermis.&#160; He thought to himself that an unrecognized
universe had existed right there in his shoes.&#160; He sniffed his
armpits. They were fetid as glue but he liked the transmission of
the sweat molecules up his nostrils.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He deeply inhaled the glue and then
held his breath allowing the fumes to permeate within. He repeated
the process four or five times and for the most part he, they, and
all went away in a haze.&#160; It was like being blindfolded but
instead of darkness there was a soft patch of white haze. At first
it startled him and he wondered if this ethereal gaseous mist was
Saddam Hussein&#8217;s lethal spray upon the world and yet he felt
giddy in this laughing gas. When his mind was able to register the
fact that they were seated next to him, the haze made the man and
his woman, the shoe barterer, the sky crier, and all&#160;
(transient and non-transient, imagined and remembered) such special
creatures.&#160; These transients were sordid and brainless but,
especially in the intense inundation of fumes they were the most
extraordinary of life forms. He was almost moved to kiss each of
them on their foreheads. From this pillar of light the mosquito,
dressed in Buddhist attire and carrying its mask, came with the
force of God.&#160; Its feelers were like acid and when they
touched Jatupon his clothes seemed to sizzle and burn away.&#160;
He was naked with a smashed ant sandwiched between a fingernail and
skin.&#160; He remembered that a minute earlier he had been trying
to direct it away from his leg and in his clumsy misdirection at
the appearance of the pillar of light there it was under the nail
curled up in fetal agony.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As the mosquito slowly descended he
could see tragedy more clearly than he ever did when not snorting
the fumes, and yet it rolled off his mind weightlessly. He was
giddy in brotherly love and yet naked, he wanted to copulate with
the world.&#160; Even more, he wanted to reproduce his ideas with
her. He sensed that all humans fell victim to this substance: they
got giddy in love and reproduced, they gained meaning in their
lives from this feeling, and then after nature got them to beget
children, she plugged up the dopamine somewhat like the waning high
he felt with his brother. He felt the insect monster inject him
with the malaria of tragedy: random images were kicked about in his
mind like starving dogs allowed to propagate on the streets
incessantly from the non-interference of Buddhist principles.&#160;
He saw all the suffering species from an aerial perspective for he
was being carried around on the wings of the mordant mosquito that
had scooped him up on its back. Buddha knew that tragedy abounded
in recycled life but Jatupon could not figure out if Buddha tried
to break the recycling of life like a coward who couldn&#8217;t
endure pain or if he left his protective palace to understand the
magnitude of human suffering for the masses.&#160; The story was
full of contradictions. He thought, "Where are you taking
me...straight...now spinning...now plunging...more G-force than I
think I can stand."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; "Into yourself," it shouted.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "That's a cruel place to be," Jatupon
said.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Yes, it is," admitted the mordant
entity.&#160; From their distance distinct forms were difficult to
ascertain but he knew that he was far outside himself and to be
outside of it into a world of motion and forms made him feel
relieved.&#160; But from a couple of indecipherable forms in
movement he halfway made out and half way imagined a half-naked
baby crying on the outskirts of a park.&#160; It crawled alone at a
distance from a cook.&#160; The cook halted her work to get
him.&#160; He cried loudly at each initiative at trying to appease
him.&#160; He didn&#8217;t like being held.&#160; He didn&#8217;t
like the banana put in his hands. Finally, she placed him in the
bucket of water that contained her dirty plates.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;So innocent and yet
calculating,&#8221; said the mosquito.&#160; &#8220;It was wanting
in that tub of water all along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Oh, do you see them
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No, not really.&#160; Anyhow,
based on what you see, wouldn&#8217;t you agree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Agree that he crawled away so as
to cause his mother to put him in the water?&#8221;&#160; He
laughed.&#160;&#160; &#8220;No, he is just a baby.&#160; I
don&#8217;t think he is that developed.&#160; I don&#8217;t think
he is that self serving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Are these two forms you are now
seeing outside of yourself too?&#8221; asked the mosquito.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Of course,&#8221; he scoffed but
he did not know.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Then he was descending or falling
--falling in a diagonal descent on the mosquito's back, falling
onto its feelers, and falling from it entirely. There he was a
brown boy in the pool on the roof of The Mall Ayuttaya with goggles
on his face and wearing spandex swimming trunks.&#160; He looked so
fashionable despite his poverty but the poor and discontent always
found their stealth means to master petty thievery and a sullied
self-image was easily forgotten.&#160;&#160; There were imitation
mountains and waterfalls all around. He swam to the opposite side
of the pool and said hello to a foreigner who sat on a rock letting
the force of the fall hit his feet.&#160; The foreigner ignored him
and again started swimming his laps.&#160; Then, feeling that he
had been rude, he returned to the boy and asked him his name. The
boy smiled and said an easy two-syllable name, Nawin. It seemed
like an easy name for a foreigner to remember. After an uneventful
attempt at conversations in two different languages to which
neither party could understand the other one, the foreigner swam
off.&#160; Still the boy was persistent, swimming over to the
foreigner when he rested.&#160; This prompted the foreigner to go
to the locker room to change sooner than what he would have done
otherwise.&#160; The boy followed him.&#160; He accosted him while
he was at the urinal and looked down onto him.&#160; He tried to
come in when the foreigner was in his cubicle taking a
shower.&#160; His motives for doing so were ambiguous ones: he
wanted a foreigner friend even if this man was so much older than
he was, he wanted to really learn the international language, and
although he did not really have sexual feelings he would have done
anything for a bit of money.&#160; As the man dressed on the bench
Jatupon, the boy, put his hands together in a mendicant grasshopper
pose with palms sandwiched together and held before his face in the
&#8220;wai.&#8221;&#160; He opened his hands with the opening of
the wallet.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A door of a shower booth opened.&#160;
It was the mosquito drying himself with a towel.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Nothing like a good swim
followed by a warm shower.&#160; You got to meet an old friend
today.&#160; That&#8217;s nice.&#160; Earlier you never mentioned
this memory.&#160; I guess it wouldn&#8217;t have been a
particularly flattering portrait to share with anyone.&#160; It
borders on prostitution.&#160; Just when I was feeling sorry for
you as the abused brother I learned of this.&#160; It adds a more
complex intellectual dimension to your character, don&#8217;t you
think?&#160; It makes you less moronic somehow.&#8221;&#160;
Jatupon felt a metamorphosis and returned to his 14 year old
body.&#160; Again he was riding on the mosquito&#8217;s back naked
as a blue jay and his hair dripped water.&#160; He couldn&#8217;t
confirm or negate the previous memory.&#160; It was vaguely
familiar.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe that was
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221;
Jatupon said indifferently.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "You don't think so?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "No it's not, is it?"&#160; He began to
choke on his saliva. He coughed.&#160; &#8220;Why?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Oh, dear.&#160; Are you
okay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Why what?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Why is the self such a fearful
place?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Why not?" said the mosquito.&#160;
"Alone, shut up in one's own hardened shell there is no logic--just
passions running amuck."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Tragedy and suicidal wishes clogged up
his head.&#160; He did not like seeing bits of himself crawling
around naked as a baby's ass.&#160; He hated wondering if any of
his brothers would come back to the apartment or fearing having to
beg alone.&#160; He got up.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Did you decide to finally
go back to your mamma?&#8221; asked the man who had the woman
resting her face in his lap. The woman picked a wild dandelion from
the crack in the sidewalk and then reached her hand up to
Jatupon&#8217;s shirt.&#160; She put it in his pocket.&#160;
&#8220;Here is a flower for Mommy. You can give it to her when she
fixes you supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;My mother&#8217;s dead&#8221;
Yelled Jatupon with vehement hate and repugnance as he wadded up
the flower in a fist and threw it onto the sidewalk. Then he walked
away.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A Tuc Tuc driver, slowing down in
passing, beeped the horn at him.&#160; The taxi looked like the
distorted shape of a fly.&#160; He wished that he had just a chunk
of the money Kumpee had plundered.&#160; With it, he told himself,
he would buy his own motorcycle and become a self- employed taxi
driver for his age surely restricted him from getting a job with
the Bangkok Metropolitan Authorities. This, he told himself, would
be far better than sitting on the monkey bars near the door of a
bus clanging the tube of money upon one's knee.&#160; Besides, he
didn't especially want to be one of the many nameless beggars
applying for jobs with the Metropolitan Transportation
Authorities.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He veered somehow from the
sidewalk into a labyrinth of outdoor hallways that ran between
stands and quasi-stores, under canvas canopies and through the
smell of incense that came from a table that contained a 2-foot
Buddhist statue.&#160; Upon finding his way out by charging through
crowds and hangers of clothes, he heard the blaring of pi phat
music, saw a vegetable market, and smelled redolent papayas,
durians, watermelons, pineapples, guavas, and tangerines.&#160;
Further along he smelled tom yam soup, grilled squid, goo-ey tia
nam (rice noodle soup), khow laad nhaa gai (rice with chicken and
bamboo), and other dishes in an outdoor restaurant.&#160; He passed
silk stores, jewelry stores that catered toward ruby and
sapphire-loving foreigners, and fast food restaurants.&#160; Then
he went into Robinson Department Store.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the restroom he relieved himself at
a urinal that was furthest from the cleaning lady since her mopping
presence there made him nervous and had the possibility of clogging
him up.&#160; Then he sat down in the food court.&#160; His head
was in vertigo like small children turning themselves around in the
grass or the routine of one&#8217;s petty kinetic life.&#160; He
often noticed affluent men walking around with girlfriends or wives
in that male gesture of the hand of one arm clasping the other arm
behind the back. The gesture conveyed that they were beyond the
third world now.&#160; They had money, Bangkok had everything, and
they would shop as befitting their status.&#160; He wanted to be
them.&#160; He wanted out of his own skin to be a different person
entirely but there was no exit for him in fast motion.&#160; The
only consolation was in always evolving beyond that one seed, that
one dividing cell that had started his life.&#160; There was still
hope.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He saw a father and two
girls with their many bags.&#160; He wanted a father like that
instead of the one who had made him afraid to stand up, sit down,
comb his hair, put on his pants, talk, or be silent without being
excoriated. Only arduous work had offered him a respite from that
man&#8217;s criticism.&#160; Only work had offered him that escape
from being the cockroach running from his heels. Family wasn't so
ideal.&#160; At least his wasn&#8217;t.&#160; He was always
cravenly scurrying away from one or more of them and vibrations
they made. His mind spun around more wildly.&#160; He kept wishing
that it would stay stolid and poised as statues of the Garuda and
Kinnara, mythological creatures that permeated Thai art,
literature, and dance.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He tried to focus in on beautiful
ideas of family.&#160; He tried to breathe them in like the smell
of drying clothes in the breeze or the smells of life replicating
itself eternally in the verdant greenery on the outskirts of the
city.&#160; All he could do was summon memories of Kumpee and their
parents incessantly driven toward chasing any scheme that would put
a few extra coins in their hands; Kazem's secondhand treatment of
his destitute brown Burmese woman a couple years earlier; Suthep
whom he shared certain childish sympathies; and Kazem who was his
protector.&#160;&#160; His head hurt and span:
in&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
school, out of school, struggling for subsistence as a group, the
heads of the group dying, the move to Bangkok, and a thousand
phantom faces that plagued his mind, exacerbating the throbbing. He
tried to think of monks in their saffron robes with strapped
metallic bowls dangling from their shoulders to which shopkeepers
requiring blessings placed rice; the sweet taste of rambutans when
the spiky core was broken and the transparent succulent egg was
overtaken; and motorcycle taxi drivers with cardboard and pop
bottle games that, with the tap of the nails of their fingers, kept
their time of waiting from overwhelming them in boredom.&#160; A
persistent fly over the table made him nervous and he thought that
perhaps to counter the truths his subconscious spewed out in the
form of the insect and his own need for stability (not just his
environment changing but he, himself, was continually changing) he
needed to invent a god for himself if nothing other than the God of
Dirty Underwear.&#160; The persistent fly continued to besiege him
so he left the department store and returned to his friends.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The "friends"--he did not know their
names--seemed content with their circumstances. They, like he, were
cuddled together under the overpass consuming and inhaling their
amphetamine and glue molecule treats, which inadvertently gave them
ice cream headaches. This intake delivered them from bleak
realities to that of twirling and dizzy children while fantasies
stepped forward as emperors of the spinning domain. At times when
they were more conscious of their existence and surroundings
(especially when feeling intensely hungry) these transients would
beg.&#160; They had a method.&#160; If someone in a suit carrying a
cellular telephone were standing in front of the cash register at a
nearby convenience store with a long serpentine tail of customers
waiting behind him, one of them would enter the store. Shocked by
such a lugubrious display and needing to quickly expedite his exit
with his bags, such an individual would give generously so as to
not be perceived as parsimonious or niggard in the reaction.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It occurred to him that this
word, &#8220;friend,&#8221; was not really what it at first
seemed.&#160; If indeed people were all users attracted to others
who gave them fresh insight into life or a respite for escaping it,
these people were dismissed when that resource was exhausted.&#160;
Still he wasn&#8217;t all that fond of them so the issue did not
really matter all that much. He tried to smile at them but he could
not. He was feeling sick to his stomach and their faces sometimes
spun around in an erratic orbit.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It was like feeling the
rush of air and dizzying changes of streets and buildings from the
open portals of an old doorless bus that cast its shadow onto a
bridge connecting Pinklao street to the area around the Grand
Palace--how palpitating was this glue and amphetamine trip.&#160;
At times it was a stronger feeling of thrust and omnipotent
dominion like a surfer who could easily be plummeted by the waves
he was riding.&#160; The waves, however, were verdant and edible.
It was verdant the way nature at times looked like a green-berry
cheesecake, and bovine, he wanted to eat it.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Seated under the stairwell of steps
doing nothing in particular, he at times took out his pocket knife
and engraved a puppet man driven on forcefully by its master to the
pleasure and frenzy of rape, depositing its seeds in every possible
hole (fertile or fallow).&#160; This alone was his only conscious
achievement that day in a drug induced but sobering mind where
subconscious images usurped their rational rulers.&#160; Careful
not to look threatening with a knife in his hands, he timidly
scraped out a master controlling the puppet man depositing himself
in that meek lowly being.</p>

Chapter 6</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Nawin!&#8221; Porn
whiningly bantered as she confiscated his headphones that were
plugged into the arm of his seat and punched him in his chest.
&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you talking to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#8220;Rachmaninoff,&#8221; he said.&#160;&#160; She did not
understand. What did she know beyond the kinetic rhythms of pop
culture?&#160; It was in her blank stare.&#160; The word had not
penetrated.&#160; He wanted to tell her.&#160; He wanted to
introduce if not explain something so ineffable and orphic to which
a mortal could only awkwardly utter that inadequate word,
&#8220;beautiful.&#8221;&#160; He wanted to see the countenance of
one being extended.&#160; He wanted to change her and take her far
beyond the limits she had placed upon herself.&#160; It was the
best of him that wanted to bring the love of great things to
others. It was one altruistic motive in his many selfish
motivations for inviting her here. But he knew that like earlier,
when they were waiting in the airport, she would continue to bury
herself in comic books and the latest American sounds when not
engrossed in her French palaver with the cassette recorder.&#160;
She would continue to disconnect the ideals and harmonies from the
plug in the arm of his chair.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I want to know what you are
thinking,&#8221; she said.&#160; Her countenance was puzzled and
remained so for a couple seconds.&#160; He loved her so much then.
He breathed in deeply and wished outside himself to the cosmic
forces that she could stay with those features forever: puzzled,
probing, and beautiful! .</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Sometimes you leave me, Nawin,
and I want to know where you go in those thoughts of yours.&#160;
Were you thinking of her--Noppawan?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m always thinking of
her.&#160; I&#8217;m married to her.&#8221;&#160; He reached for
her hand but she rejected it and so he smiled brightly, kissed her
on the cheek, and gave her a hug.&#160; &#8220;No, I was probably
riding in my artsy whims.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Not a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No, actually not a
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;That&#8217;s not
natural.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He chuckled. &#8220;There are other
things than loving people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You are an unnatural
person, Nawin.&#8221;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He smiled and thought.&#160; Maybe
dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, the components of love,
were at work whenever one cared about something.&#160; Maybe being
troubled by Palestinians blowing themselves up was love.&#160;
Certainly Rachmaninoff was love.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Her glasses are ugly, you
know.&#160; They have thick frames and what really makes them ugly
is that they are dark against her dark skin. No, what really makes
her ugly when she wears them is that the lenses are thick like
binoculars. I bet that even when she removes them every night
before she goes to bed she probably looks as plain as burnt toast.
Your wife isn&#8217;t pretty, Nawin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; He chortled.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;re
right,&#8221; he said as his eyes looked down shamefully.&#160; He
thought about telling Porn that Noppawan never removed her glasses
when she went to bed. It was partly true.&#160; He had even had sex
with her once or twice that way.&#160; Then he had second thoughts
and decided that some things were better left alone in the dark.
&#8220;Can I go back to Rachmaninoff?&#8221; he asked while mildly
shaking his headphones in the air.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#8220;No you can&#8217;t.&#160; Thanks
for asking.&#160; When are we going to New York City,
Nawin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;We haven&#8217;t arrived in
Canada yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; She stood up, stretched,
and then crawled over his lap lasciviously as she looked out of the
window. &#8220;This flight is too long,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Maybe the pilot, co-pilot,
hijacker, or whoever is driving can park for a few minutes on a
cloud and you can get out,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; She sat back in her seat.&#160;
&#8220;I think you are angry at me for saying that about
Noppawan.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No,&#8221; he said
indifferently.&#160; He liked hearing truth but he felt guilty
being amused by some of it.&#160; He changed the subject.&#160;
&#8220;Do you want to change to my seat so that you can look
out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;d get sick looking out
onto that sea of clouds for long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why do you want to go to New
York City?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;What&#8217;s in Canada,
Nawin?&#160; It&#8217;s got a few walking snowmen but what
else?&#160; Snowy landscapes and cold temperatures good for
penguins.&#160; When someone thinks of Thailand it is always Thai
silk, temples, Buddhist statues, nightlife, and beautiful girls
like me.&#160; What is the symbol of Canada?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Snowmen,&#8221; said Nawin as he
chuckled, &#8220;and Canadian dollars.&#8221;&#160; He was enjoying
the conversation.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;What are they: these
snowmen?&#160; Are they just Englishmen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;That but also Americans who
didn&#8217;t want to fight against King George&#8230;&#160;
Frenchmen, of course in Montreal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why don&#8217;t they have kings
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Well, Canadians do have the
British monarchy.&#160; Canada is a commonwealth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He didn&#8217;t go further because she
sighed from intellectual strain.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you like Noppawan
at all?&#8221; he asked with childish vulnerability.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No,&#8221; she replied
thoughtfully.&#160; &#8220;I liked all things about her.&#160; I
liked her completely. &#8220;It is hard to believe that anyone
should be so wonderfully odd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He liked that response
exponentially.&#160; He knew that she would never say anything so
true.&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Montreal will be fun.&#160; A little
bit of Paris and a little bit of New York City.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Laos, Nawin, is a little bit of
Paris with a lot of dirt poor Thailand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;It will be like going to the
Thao Suranari fair in Nakhon Ratchasima.&#8221;&#160; That was one
of the largest fairs in Thailand.&#160; This thought triggered his
memory of a smaller fair in Bangkok.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This avuncular stranger, a member
of the parliament and the former governor of Pattaya, had informed
Kumpee that the fair held in March was coming to a close this
year.&#160; This fair, run by government ministries to raise funds
for the Red Cross, was near the Parliament in the area called
Dusit.&#160; Tickets to enter were sold at 200 baht each.&#160; The
two other brothers--all, like him, boys with layers of manhood like
aluminum foil wrapped over the small crumbling pieces of cake that
were themselves&#8212;did not utter questions.&#160; Had Kazem
robbed Thai Farmers Bank, Siam Commercial, and Bangkok Bank
entirely it wouldn't have made any difference.&#160; The psyche
needed a degree of ebullience.&#160; This was their respite from
worries about survival to which drugs or snookers had been
ineffective distractions. A bit of it insulated them from the
attitude of doom that would eagerly zip them up into its body
bags.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A woman wearing a pointed straw hat,
who had a 2-year-old baby cuddled around her neck, thrust herself
before them.&#160; She solicited them to her table of snake blood
refreshments seasoned with dried monkey brain. She was one
well-seasoned in salesmanship.&#160; She knew the cajolery to lure
daredevils who would come to such a fair as she knew the approach
to children whom she would sell her krathongs, banana boats of
flowers and candles attached to banana leafs and Styrofoam sailed
onto the river for good fortune during each Loi krathong festival,
or Buddhist rosaries and necklaces to old women during religious
holidays.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220; Please come over to my
table, boys.&#8221;&#160; They smiled and came. &#8220; I know
you.&#160; You think I don&#8217;t but I do.&#160; I can see into
hearts&#8212;hearts wanting to be men, wanting to end
boyhood.&#160; You&#8217;ve heard those stories about men who
became more than that from drinking a bit of this.&#160; The
stories aren&#8217;t true. &#160;They are stupid.&#160; Nobody has
ever done anything like that; but the real parts of the stories are
gaining courage and strength. My husband was in his teens when I
saw him for the first time doing what you are about to do.&#160; I
watched him the way those girls over there are watching you
now.&#160; Anybody would have second thoughts about this.&#160;
Anybody would. It tastes horrible because it is strong in courage
and strength for those with the courage to drink it. If you can do
this you will never run away from anything again. Instead, you will
have it on the run. This is your only time to conquer your fears
and do something naughty while the police are sleeping.&#160;
Whatever you do, make sure that you put a few coins in the box to
help the Red Cross.&#8221;&#160; She pointed at the plastic box at
a distant corner of the table.&#160; While Suthep inserted a few
baht into the hole she directed herself to Kazem.&#160; &#8220;Are
those two your brothers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I know you won&#8217;t make them
ashamed of you. It&#8217;s just fifty baht each.&#160; Look.&#160;
People are staring at you. You&#8217;ve got to do it.&#160;
Drink!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Drink, money man,&#8221;
reiterated Suthep.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He glared at Suthep. &#8220;Hey,
I&#8217;m not paying for me alone.&#160; I&#8217;ll do it for the
pure pleasure of seeing you stand there all night looking into your
cup.&#8221; Kazem paid for three cups.&#160; Jatupon stood there
stiff and frightened. Starting from the oldest to the youngest they
drank down their beverages.&#160; The liquid molecules of hell were
a hundred times that of the airborne ones from Kumpee&#8217;s socks
and shoes.&#160; All of them choked and coughed.&#160; All of them
swallowed some of the blood heathenishly but spit out most.&#160;
It was followed by a sip of watery and caffeinated whiskey that had
been diluted and adulterated in cola.&#160;&#160; Normally such
open liquor drinking would have gotten everyone arrested especially
when it involved selling to minors but since some of the proceeds
were going into the public fund on this day it was
overlooked.&#160; While the brothers were given a second shot of
whiskey again diluted in cola, new customers came to the woman
anxiously.&#160; She led them to her table and sat there with the
squalling, squalid child.&#160; The baby was restless on the apron
that she wore.&#160; Conscious of how a repetition of her spiel
could spell out insincerity and a customer&#8217;s aversion, she
attempted to wait silently as they debated doing this. She muted
the child with a firm hand pressed against its mouth. Before she
could make the sell she reflexively responded to the smallest
degree of wetness on the apron and let her child urinate away from
the sidewalk and her virility stand.&#160; The ground did not
eagerly swallow the fetid and sweet liquid and his recidivous urine
came back to the sidewalk with the insistence of a foul stream.
Past Shoe salesmen on a sheet, shoe repairmen, comb and battery
salesmen, noodle workers, and lottery representatives-- unlicensed
businesses that abounded everywhere&#8212; they entered the gates
of the fair. At kiosks, the three of them threw darts, shot
basketballs in moving hoops, and bounced balls against walls to
knock over bottles for prizes.&#160; They continued doing this
until the infancy of night murdered the sun allowing it to slowly
die, languishingly sliding off golden rooftops of temples.&#160;
When darkness unfolded around them, they paid to see a woman put
her face in a plastic box of scorpions,&#160; elephant trainers
whose elephants walked over them to enter into the crowds where
they picked up humans with their trunks, and oarsmen in the
facsimiles of royal barges competing against each other.&#160; The
boats had the same body and countenance of dragons just like the
television shows they had seen of the kings&#8217; ancient boats
that were housed in the Royal Barge
Museum.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The night and
its dark appetites were mature in full insurrection.&#160; They had
eaten their share of rice and chicken topped with cotton candy, and
yet not cowering, their stomachs craved for beer so they headed to
a nearby bar.&#160;&#160; Before them a child was walking slowly on
the steps that rose up to the bridge that went over a canal.&#160;
He slammed his fire-snappers against the cement watching the air
burst before his feet. They passed him to quickly fulfill the
surfeit of beer that was part of their general yearnings. They
yearned for so much--these three young men.&#160; They yearned for
relaxation with beer; they yearned for friends and places away from
this fraternal group that they had been conceived into and forced
to work with; and, except for Jatupon, they each yearned for a love
to come their way so that they would not be lost in themselves.
Jatupon yearned most to be naively complete like that boy they had
passed.&#160; Jatupon had once been like him: fascinated by his own
thoughts and sensations and self-contained. In late boyhood a boy
mastered independence that in infancy and early boyhood he
struggled to achieve.&#160; It was all thwarted, however, by the
upsurge of sexual feelings which made a young man want to bond
cohesively and addictively to others.&#160; The progress of late
boyhood was razed in a brief year or two.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Strangely, the world
was a dreamy place and from the modest display of fireworks being
shot over the canal there was a dreamy idea of connectedness and
fraternity in the psyches of these young men although such ideals
varied from moment to moment based upon their interpretations of
the environment. Lagging behind in serpentine movements of
dreaminess but eager for connectedness, Jatupon hurriedly caught up
to his brothers only to lag behind them again.&#160; It was time
for Heineken, Singh, or Bush (not those two presidents).&#160; It
was a time to celebrate and dunk the self in artificial dreaminess
like one bobbing for apples.&#160; Jatupon looked up at the sky
when he and his brothers reached the other side of the bridge. Then
he looked down at his chest. A sweat bee hovered over the glands in
his opened shirt like an oil worker ciphering the ground. He shoved
the industrial exploiter away.&#160; He felt awe in how complex it
all was: one thing feeding on another.&#160; He wondered if, after
the immune system conquered a virus, it consumed it.&#160; He
wondered how much of his parents&#8217; bodies would have been
consumed by bacteria in decomposition if they had not been
cremated. He wondered if things were so clearly defined.&#160;
Maybe a part of his parents was alive in ways that could be sensed
but never understood or explained.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It was no wonder, as they sat there
drinking beer in a pub on the other side of the canal (remarkably
able to afford drinking beer at all) that Kazem was happy: after
all, the uncle's gate had opened up to him when he talked into a
speaker.&#160; It was also not so strange that his mood of elation
had for a short while, when viewing the scorpion lady, gone awry.
Seeing the son of the Ayutthaya landlord who had rented his family
that small space for their restaurant was depressing.&#160; There
he was in his fine clothes with his wife and two small
children.&#160; Kazem had thought to himself that as a rich man
poverty had not ruined his inclinations&#8212;this man, not much
older than himself, copulated in the right hole.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Suthep, sandwiched between his
two brothers, drank voraciously without any strong inclination to
run away.&#160; He preferred being elsewhere but elsewhere without
money was nowhere.&#160; He preferred playing snookers and trying
to woo a young girl to be somewhat interested in him while playing
against his buddies.&#160; Here, however, he had no friends.&#160;
The city was entirely new and he didn&#8217;t know anyone. Once, in
Ayutthaya, he had gone with a herd of those wolves to capture a
park whore.&#160; He and his buddies took her to a cheap guesthouse
where foreigners often went and had their spasms within her. It had
been his first time. He would prefer to be with his friends but
this wasn&#8217;t so bad.&#160; Drinking with his brothers was like
playing football with them once again or fishing with them at the
edge of the river.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Somewhere into things the beer
changed to whiskey and it was from that bottle of whiskey that the
mosquito and his female counterpart climbed out and shook off their
wetness. When this canine shaking of the wetness was not enough,
they used the paper towels as bath towels.&#160; They were less
grotesquely large at this point but returning to their monstrous
shapes by the moment.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>--What was the dinner like that Kazem attended?</p>

<p>--It was not a dinner, but the sip of the man's coffee in the
den. It consequently led to the proposal of a dinner.</p>

<p>--And did he accept the proposal?</p>

<p>--He did.</p>

<p>--On behalf of the family of brothers?</p>

<p>--That would seem to be a correct assessment although the eldest
was not expected to attend. No definitive date was scheduled
because the senator hesitated about this issue.&#160; It was a
tacit declaration that could only be read in a scarce trace of
caution on his countenance.&#160; It indicated that he was
reluctant to be associated with these thugs.&#160; This irritated
Kazem and yet he pretended as if he wasn&#8217;t bothered by
it.&#160; He probably told himself that he needed the time to
rehearse his lines.</p>

<p>--What would he need to rehearse?</p>

<p>--His part as the benevolent older brother.&#160; He thought he
was that but he had trouble convincing others of its veracity.</p>

<p>--I don&#8217;t understand.</p>

<p>--A typical female reaction.&#160; Let me be more lucid.&#160;
It is my impression that he intended to use this first meeting for
future ones where he could use sympathy as a way of extorting money
from the aging man for this group of leeches and quasi-pariahs.</p>

<p>&#160;--As Kazem and the senator/former governor of
Pattaya/former uncle-in-law drank coffee together, what was the
lure that kept him interested in these boys?&#160; After all, he
knew them only by name apart from that time or two of being
irritated by their noise when the two families came together. That
was over a decade ago. Isn&#8217;t that right?</p>

<p>--Yes, you are not ignorant.&#160; It was 11 years ago.&#160; I
believe his new founded interest in them was what they call
empathy?</p>

<p>--Empathy?&#160; I know about that.&#160; It is a rather rare
and abnormal form of behavior sometimes seen in those evolving
beyond their species.&#160; From the research I&#8217;ve done on
such aliens empathy and compassion seem to be the only emotions
that aren&#8217;t destructive and hedonistic. In small quantities
all emotions aid judgment calls in social situations but
unfortunately they are produced and expended in bulk. Unlike other
emotions that are rampant, empathy and compassion tend to be quite
rare.&#160; Could you elaborate on his nascent burgeoning of
empathy for them and the disingenuousness that prompted
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220; It was no different than their
aunt who hustled a marriage out of him years ago. Kindliness and
loneliness, from what I can tell, have always been his
weakness.&#160; It was a simple calculating maneuver on Kazem's
part, really. Kazem affected being uncomfortable and shy.&#160; He
waited until this uncle asked directly about his circumstances and
then he gave a modest biographical summary of their move to Bangkok
after selling their parents assets.&#160; He was careful not to
mention Kumpee, the need for money, or any real description of how
they were living.&#160; The uncle's attempts at finding out
information on those putrescent issues were only marginally
successful.&#160; As a result, it seemed to the senator that Kazem
was earnest and unassuming. He became more curious and anxious to
help these pariahs as a result.</p>

<p>--And can you be more specific on how this was done?</p>

<p>--It&#8217;s rather mundane. I don't wish to really.</p>

<p>--Human studies and our intellectual copulation require more
information. One would have to be ignorant to not know that or
male.</p>

<p>--He chitchatted, my dear, in a logical sequence that was a bit
desultory at times. Humans call such an inexact order "variation."
After he told the location of where they were living and that the
move had taken place because of Kumpee&#8217;s desire to be near
his girlfriend, he answered the senator&#8217;s question on what
his brothers were doing in their state of unemployment (Jatupon
with his comic books and Suthep with his snookers).&#160;&#160;
Then he moved to large ideas outside of his personal life: the
upcoming elections for prime minister, the question of the
government&#8217;s role for the flood victims in Hattayai, and if
the senator would run for re-election in a couple years.&#160; It
was done to create a mystique about he and his brothers as well as
to elicit the approval of the senator who preferred people who
could break out of their own skins.&#160; It was deferential.&#160;
It was noble.&#160; It was all of those things that were
manipulation in a consummate performance.&#160; Kazem played the
part so well that he even began to think that he was this shy,
vulnerable, unpretentious, and caring person despite trying
circumstances.</p>

<p>--Did he directly attempt to exploit the man's feelings of
sympathy for their plight or the senator's loneliness?</p>

<p>--In some respects he did. He reminisced about his mother whom
this high governing uncle had sympathy.&#160; The senator of course
entertained this sympathy because his wife (their mother's sister)
had always carped, disparaged, and vilified her for such a marriage
to an illiterate street person.&#160; The senator never forgot his
sister-in-law's birthday even after his divorce. To be specific,
Kazem was seated before the senator drinking coffee and eating
doughnuts when he ironically spoke of how he missed the scents of
flowers his mother would bring into the home or the smell of a
freshly cleaned floor. It belied the truth of this porcine creature
whose domestic tendencies had surrendered to male nastiness early
into marriage and motherhood. The sad lonely tone resonated with
the senator.&#160; It strummed the harp of his heart.&#160;</p>

<p>--What are these three brothers doing at present?</p>

<p>--At present they are drinking beer and celebrating with some of
the money that the senator gave to them.</p>

<p>--Did the senator give money that quickly?</p>

<p>--No, he dismissed Kazem after tiring of him.&#160; He said that
he needed to return to his work.&#160; And then as the teenage boy
was leaving a servant told him to return the next day.&#160; It was
then that a sizable amount of money, by the standards of regular
Thai people, was given to him.</p>

<p>--Suthep doesn't seem as happy as the other two.</p>

<p>--He is happy with the money and the beer but his happiness
sinks down with the dying fizz of the beer but it rejuvenates again
with the fizz of the next beer.&#160; His behavior can be
attributed to a bit of repugnance toward the two companions at his
table and a bit of general moodiness aggravated with alcohol
consumption.&#160; He really has been so moody ever since becoming
a teenager. He was so nice to Jatupon as a child.&#160; Oh well,
the world is continually in flux.</p>

<p>--The youngest brother whom they sometimes maliciously nickname
Jatu-PORN now seems to be sad.&#160; What could he be thinking at
this most auspicious evening?</p>

<p>--He is thinking of Suthep thinking that these lovers are
repugnant.</p>

<p>--And I assume that Suthep is now thinking that he is thinking
this.</p>

<p>--Now you understand why these creatures never go
anywhere.&#160;</p>

<p>--How alone these fickle creatures must be never sure of the
acumen of their own ideas.&#160; These ideas seem to change from
minute to minute based upon the chemistry of the food they put into
their bodies, their perceptions of their own failures, the
limitations of work and routine, their hormones, the firing of
neurotransmitters left and right, the pleasures gained in social
interaction, memories from the past, the mood generated from the
environment, and the well-being of the body.&#160; How lost they
must feel wincing from their forlorn inner selves by clinging to
others around them.&#160; Is not one of them self-contained?</p>

<p>--No, my dear, I'm afraid not.</p>

<p>--Your summary is very orgasmic, my husband.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Mosquitoes 1 and 2 changed angles, this
time looking into each other's left eyes.&#160; They were
mesmerized in each other&#8217;s beings and their wings flickered
from the internal fire of passively intellectualizing life's
energetic insignificance.&#160; Then they looked away from each
other and breathed deeply before once again looking at each other
face to face with less intensity.</p>

<p>--Wouldn&#8217;t you say that the older brother, Kazem,
possessed a lot of effrontery to go to the speaker on the brick
wall connecting to a gate, push the button, and talk so glibly?
Could a clarification be gained on how it is that he could have
acquired that entrance?</p>

<p>--It could.&#160; Such an individual gained entrance by stating
that his mother, prior to her death, had prepared a gift for her
brother-in-law in celebration of the Songkran Thai New Year&#8217;s
festival</p>

<p>--And what gift did he present to the man as they drank tea and
coffee?</p>

<p>--He presented to the man a Buddhist necklace his mother had
given to his father.</p>

<p>--And the politician took it?</p>

<p>--Not immediately.&#160; He of course resisted; but Kazem argued
persuasively that it had been intended for him.&#160; It looked
new, although the politician wasn&#8217;t under much of an illusion
that it was.&#160; Still, in case it was a gift from the dead, he
couldn&#8217;t really refuse it.&#160; That would have hurt the
brothers and the memory of the woman.</p>

<p>--And as the brothers drink beer together, do the younger ones
notice that this somewhat expensive trinket that Kazem had
heretofore claimed as his own and had worn around his neck is now
missing.</p>

<p>--The more perceptive one called Jatupon notices this and infers
that he really did give a gift to the senator and it was probably
the necklace.</p>

<p>--They do play their games of trying to affect future
outcomes.&#160; They&#8217;d be better being as insentient as
cows.&#160; The youngest should drink his beer and be happy to be
with the big boys engaging in the naughtiness of illegal alcohol
consumption. Instead he seems worried.</p>

<p>--He&#8217;ll be returning like a bound slave.&#160; The noodles
will bind him once again when the equipment needed for the sidewalk
restaurant is purchased.&#160; He feels that he did not take
advantage of the brevity of freedom?</p>

<p>--To do what?</p>

<p>--He doesn&#8217;t know either.&#160; Even more troubling, he is
also assessing that his brothers are growing up.&#160; He wonders
if they will soon desert this first family. He wonders if for the
pleasure of women they&#8217;ll jettison the earlier notion of
family as insignificant, weighty, and likely to cause them to
sink.&#160; He wonders if they will cast it out like a bad dream
that they want to forget. He knows that they are biologically
driven by hungers like a mouse cognizant of the trap but eating the
cheese anyway.</p>

<p>---What would he do as a cast away?</p>

<p>--Well, there are ways of survival.&#160; One can be out there
selling his body one moment and then find his head shaved and a
robe on what had been out there as a marketable commodity.</p>

<p>--Such a transformation from prostitute to a monk&#160; really
occurs?</p>

<p>--Indeed, it does.&#160; When the goals of money don&#8217;t
arise well from prostitution, being a monk is a position that
commands respect and an escape from destitution.&#160; It has a
morose facade but in such a somber demeanor like that of Jatupon it
has its own splendor</p>

<p>--What splendor can be had in such a pointless and austere
profession?</p>

<p>--Well for one, a given monk might put on some military clothes
and go off to the local masseuse for a Thai massage of the most
dissolute dimensions.&#160; It is an easy thing for a young monk to
do: just take the expense for the whore out of the monastery
coffer</p>

<p>--When Buddha was born in Lumpini Park in Nepal was it so that
men might engage in the recidivism of their animalistic
natures?</p>

<p>--All you need to do to answer that question is see the types of
whores parading themselves in Lumpini Park in Bangkok, Thailand not
to mention the male prostitutes waiting for money and sexual
experiences in the shadows of the trees. Everything changes.&#160;
Good men are distorted into Gods, and philosophy is made into a
sordid religion. Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism&#8212;it
is all a perversion of the founder&#8217;s ideas.</p>

<p>--How do you know these things?</p>

<p>--What things?</p>

<p>--About the meeting with the senator</p>

<p>--How do I know about the meeting with the senator?</p>

<p>--Yes, how do you know this?</p>

<p>--How do I know this? mumbled the mosquito
confoundedly.&#8212;They are in Jatupon&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>--And how does he know them?</p>

<p>--How does he know them?&#160; Because of the night when they
were drinking together&#8230;the night of the fair&#8230;were you
sleeping when I was talking to you?</p>

<p>--No, I heard you earlier.&#160; So it came from Kazem&#8217;s
mouth and Jatupon&#8217;s conjectures.&#160; Those doesn&#8217;t
seem like reliable sources.</p>

<p>--What?</p>

<p>--Those don&#8217;t seem like reliable sources.</p>

<p>The two mosquitoes stared at each other nihilistically.&#160;
There was silence.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Chapter 7</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Childlike, Jatupon had assumed
that togetherness, firecrackers, celebration, and the proud moment
of that manly initiation of cold beer (not that it was his first)
to be the ending of negative events.&#160; The day had resurrected
him the way Kazem had once pulled him out of the lake on the
outskirts of the city, Kanjanaburi.&#160; He was wading then in
gradually deepening waters when the sludge beneath his feet
suddenly dipped and he was thrust off the precipice into a watery
abyss. He was just a boy then but one who owed his life to his
brother.&#160; When he was older and they had returned to
Kanjanaburi on a two-hour train ride, Kazem refused to allow him in
stagnant waters.&#160; This was fortunate since a few days later
two people died from a protozoan infection. Kazem had saved his
life in both occasions and delivered his spirit on this one.&#160;
He had never deserted him.&#160; Unlike Kumpee who despised work,
Kazem could have gotten a slave labor position by signing an
employment contract for construction work where he would have found
himself assigned to one of such places as Taipei or Abu
Dhabi.&#160; A few years there would have added a solid savings
that he could have used for vocational training that would have
broadened his opportunities. Broadened opportunities and a bit of a
savings beneath him would have provided a chance of luring a woman
who wasn&#8217;t a noodle worker.&#160; Instead, while knowing
escape was an option, he fulfilled his high shepardly calling.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As he entered the basement
cell that they lived in, Jatupon couldn&#8217;t remember a time
more linked in fraternity than this one except for the memories of
early boyhood. Boyhood was summarized in that one photograph Kazem
had salvaged out of a box of pictures that were thrown out with so
much from the move.&#160; It was a photograph that prompted a solid
memory (imagined or real).&#160; It was of the four boys.&#160;
Jatupon, three years old and fully nude, trailed behind.&#160;
Kumpee led the way.&#160; Kumpee had on a cap with the visor
inverted to the back of his head.&#160; The four of them were
walking down a sidewalk that went along the canal.&#160;
Immediately to their left and across the canal were row houses of
tiny wooden cabin shacks with metal roofs that housed residents and
their scavenging businesses.&#160; The four of them were going to
purchase some candy.</p>

<p>--They are copulating?</p>

<p>--Yes, and he has just awakened from the brother&#8217;s
penetration of him on the basement floor.&#160; The belief that the
world has been resurrected in pure and gentle intentions has been
thwarted.&#160; His brain waves are still discombobulated from the
liquor and none of what he is presently experiencing seems real. It
is though.&#160; Innocence has been disgorged like a squeezed tube
of love oil in a ride more painfully and physically intimate than
any intimacy he has yet experienced.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; His head was spinning and he
couldn&#8217;t grab himself in all of the spinning images: sounds,
smells, and visions all spun randomly.&#160; Finally there was a
bit of a shape and texture to his thinking and he dressed himself.
He wanted to use the wave of consciousness to exit.</p>

<p>--My dear, pain and pleasure have become inseparable in his
young mind.&#160; In this act a few minutes ago&#8212;maybe a few
hours ago-- there was a yearning for this violation. The abuse was
aggravated by too much alcohol consumption but it wasn&#8217;t
entirely unwanted. Being a creature of habit and addiction, Jatupon
yearned for his brother&#8212;only his brother&#8212;since he
vaguely felt that sexual experiences with two people are totally
unique and the physiological and emotional feelings his brother
induced could not be duplicated by any other person.&#160; The
madness of wishing to be overtaken, however, was confuted by
painful sodomized lances and an ejaculation of the one who did his
stress workout within him.&#160; In other experiences like this one
Jatuporn, as they call him, always masturbated to allow the desire
to peel back like a tide but this time his highest hopes were limp
like a noodle. He is opening the door.&#160; He is glancing at
himself to make sure that he isn&#8217;t wearing his underwear
outside of his pants.&#160; Now he is outside as insentient as a
fleeing animal after it has been attacked.&#160; Here he is feeling
better in the open air.&#160; He is returning.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jatupon reentered the room.&#160; For
the first time, since awakening, he noticed that Suthep had not
returned. He had not come &#8220;home&#8221;&#8212;whatever that
word meant.&#160; Jatupon scavenged the pockets of his
brother&#8217;s pants that were wadded in the corner near
Kazem&#8217;s sleeping head.&#160; In it was money and a sheet of
paper.&#160; He put it all in his pockets. He got on the first bus
he could and paid the ticket salesman. The idea crossed his mind
that being a coin collector on a city bus was not anyone&#8217;s
best choice. It would be much better to be one of the few men who
jumped onto the piers or docks to tie the city boats.&#160; Such a
Bangkok Metropolitan Authority would give three brief whistles so
the boat driver would give a backward thrust as he tied it down for
the customers to enter or depart.&#160; He could picture himself
whistling once, untying the boat he was assigned to, and jumping
onboard at the last possible second.&#160;&#160; The second
mosquito spread out its wings and copiously fluttered them about
femininely.&#160; Jatupon began to be a little conscious of himself
as a man coming out of anesthesia.</p>

<p>--But the instinct of a man is to fight off predators.&#160; Is
Jatupon never tempted to take a knife and slit his brother&#8217;s
throat?</p>

<p>--No, not for the most part, my dear.&#160; He loves his
brother; and in some ways there is intense intimacy and pleasure
involved in the novel act that he wouldn&#8217;t hardly rid himself
of despite the pain and humiliation that is involved.&#160; I
explained that earlier.&#160; Were you sleeping when we discussed
this issue?</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; There was nothing.&#160; There was
movement while he sat in a city bus.&#160; All elements had burst
out of the Big bang.&#160; All things (even ideas) were conceived
violently in movement.&#160; And so he moved, switching to busses
only when the former ones parked and all passengers had to
leave.&#160; He did not know where he was.&#160; He didn&#8217;t
care. In one bus ride he suddenly became sentient to the feel of
stiff paper in one of his pockets.&#160; He pulled it out and
looked.&#160; It was his uncle&#8217;s name and address.&#160; That
was no surprise.&#160; The bus was stalled in traffic.&#160; Riders
of busses who were near their destination began oozing out of them
like leaking oil.&#160; He realized that he was on a bus going on a
street that he had traveled on earlier in the day.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Ajarn, Do you know what street
this is?&#8221; he asked a monk.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Sukumvit&#8221; the monk
said.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Which soi are we passing?&#8221;
asked Jatupon.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Forties or fifties&#8221; said
the monk.&#160; &#8220;I really don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jatupon looked at the sheet of
paper.&#160; It read, soi 51 Sukumvit Road.&#160; He got out and
ten minutes later he was standing at the wall of the opulent
mansion that Kazem had stood at.&#160; He didn&#8217;t stay
long.&#160; He needed to go to the bathroom.&#160; He didn&#8217;t
want to wet his pants and he didn&#8217;t think that being a
distant relative with a hangover and urine splattered pants would
be very impressive to the senator.&#160; In a bathroom at a KFC he
looked at his face.&#160; It was of a dark Laotian or Khmer.&#160;
He was from a family with the last name of Biadklang from the
North.&#160; His face was as dark as the soil. He looked into the
mirror.&#160; Just with the amount of light, darkness, or
expression one appeared like a totally different person from one
moment to the next.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Where do you want to go?&#8221;
he asked the reflection in the mirror.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;To Sanam Luang to see more of
the kites&#8221; the reflection said.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On the bus ride to Sanam Luang&#160; he
had to stand.&#160; He noticed the other people.&#160; They were
also wistfully discontent for their own personal reasons.&#160;
They wished to sit down when the space was congested and there was
nowhere to sit; and in times of sitting they yearned to have vacant
seats next to their own so that they would be free from having to
sit next to strangers and could have a little area of their own to
monopolize.&#160; They were all so petty and he told himself that
he did not want to be like that.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At Sanam Luang he bought a kite from a
mendicant kite salesman.&#160; Feeling chagrin that the forlorn
child within him had taken over his thoughts instead of the man, he
flew his kite in a more obscure area.&#160; He was somewhat
relieved to find an innocent pleasure to engage in.&#160; A half
hour later the child diluted into his manhood and there he was in
full embarrassment of himself.&#160; So he reeled in the kite and
sat down on a park bench.&#160; A sidewalk salesman smiled at
him.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On a rug this mendicant had six-inch
motorcycles crafted from bamboo.&#160; Nobody knew the art of a
smile like the people in the Land of Smiles.&#160; Toothless as
babes they contrived smiles with the curl that has distinguished a
smile from a bite with a full opening of the mouth.&#160; Thai
infants and toddlers knew.&#160; They intuitively knew that with
enough naughty actions a toss into the trashcan was not
inconceivable.&#160; They intuitively knew big sister would be sold
off to a man when she turned 14 and the fetus that was little
brother or sister had been forced out by deliberately rowdy sexual
liaisons, making his or her exit no different than
menstruation.&#160; With enough shaking of the can of soda pop all
beings disgorged the same when the tab was opened.&#160; Thai
babies knew.&#160; They had their instinct to smile because of the
cellular replication planned by the DNA architect who made all Thai
babies the same as an American subdivision.&#160; How gullible was
a human to the wish of being struck down with pleasant
feelings.&#160; When a mendicant salesman with teeth sparkled them
from his tanned face even an impoverished Thai couldn&#8217;t
resist the inclination to buy. It was the congenial feeling more
than the product itself that a consumer wished to gain.&#160;
Consumers bought to get a fuzzy feeling and forget the hostile 9 to
5 working world (9 to 9 Thai time). How manipulative were the
benevolent lies of Thais in the business of survival.&#160; Jatupon
bought one of those purposeless products.&#160; He argued to
himself that he could put it on a shelf&#8212;that is, if he had a
shelf to put it on.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On the bench he pulled out of his book
bag the Lao classic, &#8220;Thao Nok Kaba Phuak which in English
meant &#8220;The White Nightjar.&#8221;&#160; The back cover said
that it depicted the second queen consort&#8217;s birth of a bird
and her exile from the kingdom.&#160; The preface stated that both
Laotian queens had prayed that life be recycled in their wombs but
only the youngest became pregnant.&#160; At the consort&#8217;s
request, the oldest queen blindfolded her when the labor pains
ensued.&#160; She solicited the help of the court magician in
particular to take advantage of the younger queen&#8217;s
squeamishness over the sight of blood by using the time to switch
the baby for that of a bird.&#160; When the child was replaced the
soothsayer could then deceive the king by making him believe that
the younger consort had had sexual relations with a foul bird
months earlier.&#160; This was not needed since the consort
actually begot a bird.&#160; Jatupon stopped reading the
preface.&#160; It was spoiling the book.&#160; He began to read the
first chapter.&#160; &#8220;I, who have composed this narrative
fled far away just like the little one for I, your servant, sleep
alone; I am very lonely, in my bedroom, with my arms dangling
empty.&#160; It is destiny that keeps me away and prevents me from
embracing my beloved.&#160; I am here, without my younger one,
since I left my home to go among the Thais where I have no
friends&#8230;&#8221; Jatupon thought about his basic nature.&#160;
He had lived for 14 years in Thailand but still to he did not feel
particularly Thai.&#160; He wished that he had been born in some
other place like America with a nice American family.&#160; As he
was falling asleep he heard the counterparts:</p>

<p>--What will happen to him on that bench?</p>

<p>-- I can&#8217;t imagine anything good happening from it.&#160;
He could apply for a job but instead he plays with his kite and
sits on the bench.&#160; He wants to be an aristocrat.</p>

<p>--You don&#8217;t say.</p>

<p>--Yes, it is true.&#160; He thinks that all whores, laborers,
and professionals are slaves.&#160; He thinks that they all have
petty lives,</p>

<p>--How would he gain such conclusions?</p>

<p>--Partly from me.&#160; Partly from the amphetamine-poppers
under the overpass.&#160; Partly from his own original thoughts. I
am surprised to see that he is half way intelligent.</p>

<p>--There isn&#8217;t much chance of him being an aristocrat.</p>

<p>--No, none.&#160; He will soon be accosted.</p>

<p>--By whom?</p>

<p>--By a man desiring to have sex with him.</p>

<p>--Explain this approach.</p>

<p>--The same as any other I presume:&#160; hello, hello, how are
you, I&#8217;m fine and how are you. The man will be thinking to
himself, while engaging in small talk, that he&#8217;ll put twenty
dollars into Jatupon&#8217;s underwear when they are alone in his
apartment. He will not have any doubts about being able to buy
him.</p>

<p>--Just for the feel of human flesh?</p>

<p>--For a human that feel is indispensable.&#160; They are
gadabouts and they expend themselves in motion as a defense
mechanism by which to avoid their own thoughts.&#160; It is the
same for feeling the silk of other skin.&#160; It breaks them from
isolation.&#160; They find their thoughts such a prison.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He and Porn had an American style
apartment.&#160; She was content with it for a few days and then
became discontent with the furniture.&#160; The chairs and the
sofas, despite their padding, were still wicker and stiff. He knew
that having the landlord take away the furnishings and using his
credit cards fully for the purchase of her wishes would not
ameliorate the discontent that all beings had and few could reign
in.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He had met her and her mommy on the
bleachers of the stadium on Ramkamhaeng Road while sketching out a
field and trees and yet still Nawin felt that she did not know who
he was.&#160; He went to classes in the morning and from late
afternoon he was busy painting.&#160; He couldn&#8217;t understand
how she thought that he should just conjure up images
instantaneously with his brush, spend money, and take her
places.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He kept avoiding the issue of taking
her across the boarder.&#160; She had a student visa since she was
technically enrolled in a language school (although she rarely
attended) so it wasn&#8217;t in fear of her visa status that made
him want to avoid the issue of the boarder.&#160; He had his
American passport and yet he still had never spent a day there. He
told himself that he should.&#160; And yet it continued to seem to
him like such a dreadful place.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He told himself that it had been a
mistake to bring her here.&#160; He hadn&#8217;t known how far the
campus was from the city.&#160; In part he chose the location with
Noppawan and Porn in mind.&#160; Still, it was a mistake and he
knew it all along.&#160; In Thailand she had seemed so
excitable.&#160; She was a gadabout and she always made friends out
of strangers from adjacent tables in restaurants they frequented.
She had seemed so open to the world.&#160; Now she seemed like such
a Victorian whore, jumping around in motion but prudishly obdurate
to change within.&#160; She was conventional&#8212;this Victorian
whore of his.&#160; Like virtually everyone else, she was part of
the big band and the universe of movement fully cognizant that the
most popular and sexy people were the ones who could twist and turn
with universal movement.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He was the oddity.&#160; This Nawin,
the romancer of whores, was all for show.&#160; Deep inside was not
impetuousness but paralysis.&#160; This artistic brooding was not
part of the natural course of events and who was he to chastise her
normalcy.&#160; He just smiled and evaded her wishes.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Chapter 8</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A little disparate to the poem, Thao
Nok Kaba Phuak, he dreamt he was a black version of a nightjar
cradled by the Laotian queen whose pigment was as light as a
northern Chinese woman.&#160; He suckled at her nipple with the
violence of his beak as she scavenged for dew to appease the
parched walls of her throat and berries that would provide her with
fortitude against failing strength. Her breast bled from his
appetites. She grappled with waning confidence that she would find
a way out of the labyrinth of trees that overtook her.&#160; She
wanted to kill this disgusting child that by its birth had usurped
her of status and had prompted her exile from the kingdom.&#160;
This feeling embroiled her psyche but feelings did not thwart her
motherly instincts for the strange creature that she named
Jatuporn.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Then, immediately in front of the park
bench there was a woman before him who carried two heavy buckets of
ice and drinks.&#160; Startled to an awakened state by the woman
asking if he wanted anything to drink, at first he gave a negative
answer, "Mashai" but then he changed it into a formal feminine
ending, "Ka" which could mean &#8220;yes.&#8221;&#160; How absurd
he must have seemed to this woman speaking like herself instead of
using the masculine word, "krub" or the neuter yes-word, "chai,"
but at the time, he had thought of himself as a bird when he spoke
and so there had not been any gender confusion whatsoever.&#160; He
paid the woman for a bottle of water.&#160; Then a man with his
stinking body holding a bag with little bags inside came to his
bench. Jatupon bought two of his bags and began strewing the ground
a few feet from the bench with the dust of crackers, breadcrumbs,
and corn.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He did this slowly while trying to
solve his indecisiveness on whether to stay or go home. The thought
of suicide seemed to him even more repellent than the two major
options but it was a tiebreaker he wasn&#8217;t going to reject
absolutely. He had a pocketknife.&#160; He thought to himself that
when night came upon him he could find an obscure area of a
tree&#8217;s shadow in complete darkness away from the gas lamps
and slit his throat. He looked down.&#160; Pigeons were beginning
to come to him and eat what he had allotted to them.&#160; He liked
giving to ostensibly small and insignificant creatures.&#160; When
the bags were empty he saved himself by his impetuousness and
returned on bus #203.&#160; He dangled from the steps because of
the lack of space provided to him. Standing there on the precipice
of the step he looked in the bus at the crowded Siamese passengers.
At moments this mosaic fusing of contortionist-bodies seemed as a
mass of amorphous human flesh, a multi-head, body, and limb
monster, which choked air and breath from the bus and, worse, had
the outline of Kazem.&#160; Bus #203 zoomed along the river and
then over the bridge of the Chao Phraya River.&#160; The cool
breezes slapped hard against his flesh.&#160; He felt like the
15-year-old nightjar that took its first flight from home,
strutting its bird-body independently and finding itself watched
attentively by the princess, the older queen's daughter-- only in
his case he was homeward bound and no one was watching him.&#160;
Matter of fact, he thought, if he were to slit his throat his body
might after some hours just be kicked off into a corner of refuse
somewhere to rot.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When he arrived in the basement cell no
one was there.&#160; He sat down in front of a strange box.&#160;
His kneecaps never splayed in the normal outward direction of
crossed legs. &#160;Moreover, attempted prayer and television
trances in imitation of the usual posture had always brought to him
extreme pain making many people over the years perceive him as
someone who was both anti-religious and, worse, counter
pop-cultural.&#160; Kazem and Suthep had vehement criticized the
shoddy construction of his kneecaps. Kazem had always been
pleasantly indifferent to this subject. As always, all he could
master before the box of chocolate was an irregular sitting posture
that looked like the letter M or W depending on the perspective;
and most likely, and most comfortably for him, the letter N as in
Nawin.&#160; It was indeed a strange sight: the letter "N" in front
of a small box of Russell Stover chocolate candies with the parent
company of Kansas City, Missouri, USA on the label.&#160; Inside,
more than half of the chocolates still remained.&#160; He helped
himself, almost feeling like an American spreading out relaxingly
over the world with Thailand and other countries as his footstool,
carefree and gormandizing chocolate down his gullet. He almost felt
that nothing bad could ever happen to him again. And then he
remembered being six years old standing with another dirty boy in
front of the Dunkin Doughnut shop near a mall in Ayutthaya looking
through the glass window that was a partition between them and the
customers who were inside. Even more, it was a partition between
feeling hungry and dirty to the immaculate ones consuming their
doughnuts within.&#160; He made funny faces and danced in front of
the window where a young man and woman sat at a counter looking
onto the commotion and air pollution of Bangkok.&#160; He pretended
to kiss the woman through the glass. She laughed and he kissed her
more. Then as the man was putting his doughnut into his mouth,
Jatupon opened his own mouth widely as if, through the glass, to
rip it out of the man's teeth with his partially rotten fangs. The
couple laughed and the man motioned them inside. They ran in and
were given doughnuts.&#160; Like then, sweets had an antithesis of
meanings for him.&#160; They made him feel as one of the elite,
carefree and happy and yet at the same time reminded him of the
disparity to which he was one of the largest masses--that being the
underclass.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Half an hour later, from his gluttony,
the box was empty. He drank some bottled water and fell asleep to
more images of Laotian queens walking through cocoa fields with
their little black birds. When Kazem came home with more shopping
bags and saw the symbol of a more auspicious life that he wished to
share with his brothers totally devoured by one alone, he wanted to
vituperate him if not slap him around a few times.&#160; He
restrained himself since, for other reasons, he did not want him to
again run away.&#160; He saw that Suthep was not in the room for
whatever reason and this absence triggered in him a desire to
molest the youngest. It would be a punishing pleasure, a desperate
hegira from one&#8217;s solitary domain to brief moments of
coupling, banging onto empty walls, the release of stress, and the
intimacy of &#8220;love&#8221;.&#160; And yet he again restrained
himself by comparing it to the gloom after masturbation.&#160; To
Kazem, a boy shoved off into manhood, sex with Jatupon was an
innocuous pleasure like some marijuana or a brief roller coaster
ride but the gloom was of being a puppet of wanton desire for
something that was far from his ultimate wish. And gloom for a man
of little self-respect was deleterious.&#160;&#160; It was fine for
the brain to forfeit logical restraint for that relaxation of
fleeting pleasure that couldn't be sustained or for one to use
whatever was before him, but someday he wanted a wife as much as he
now wanted to think that he was living up to his ideal of the
fraternal benefactor.&#160; He didn&#8217;t want his whole life
obsessed by the inconsequential pleasures of his night
sports.&#160; &#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Kazem disheveled
Jatupon&#8217;s hair with his fingers and slapped him on the
head.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Where the hell were you all day,
you bum?&#8221; he asked.&#160; &#8220;You thought we&#8217;d start
work again so you took off.&#8221; He laughed and sat down on the
sole wooden chair that was the furniture of the apartment.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to talk to
you,&#8221; Jatupon said.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I bought you both some
clothes.&#160; I don&#8217;t know if any of it will fit since
neither one of you came with me.&#160; Also, I had to see a movie
all by myself.&#160; Suthep could have had some type of a tom yam
tasting popcorn.&#160; They called it Mexican.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you get a
girlfriend and bring her with you?&#160; Isn&#8217;t that what they
are supposed to do: go with you shopping and to movies?&#8221;
Jatupon sneered.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Kazem felt an icy sword in his
heart.&#160; &#8220;I wish I could take these clothes back.&#160;
Neither of you deserve anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get a
girlfriend and leave me the hell alone,&#8221; continued Jatupon as
he turned over on his side and glared at him.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Kazem lit a cigarette, smoked, and blew
it into his brother&#8217;s face.&#160; &#8220;Because you love it
to much.&#8221;&#160; He paused.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;re right
about me getting a girlfriend.&#160; I should get a nice Chinawoman
like your brother Kumpee and then run off with her leaving the two
of you to eat worms from the sidewalk.&#160; What a good idea,
Jatuporn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jatupon turned away from him and
feigned sleep.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Sometimes he hated all of them--they
who had made a funny vulgarity of his name; Kazem, the creator of
the nickname, who solved his stress by physically accosting him;
Kumpee who always flayed and flouted him at every chance; and
Suthep who treated him with the blades of indifference (the worst
of all weapons).&#160; He vehemently hated them sometimes and
yet--</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He imagined the mosquito speaking to
him.&#160; "And yet you'll gain the antibodies of hard, fortified
indifference from the illness of hate.&#160; It isn't so bad.&#160;
It is a practical emotion that has been demonized as of late by
Buddhist and Christian practitioners although thoroughly embraced
by the Jewish, Moslem, and Hindu world.&#160; I'd think it over
carefully before exorcizing myself of it.&#160; It is just one more
darkly pragmatic aspect of life as needed imperatively as
microorganisms are needed to lunch on the deceased."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I don't want dark things.&#160; I
don't want to hate them.&#160; Tell me what to do so that I won't
hate them."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Hmm...You are such an idealist.&#160;
Well, Suthep couldn't care less about you except when he cares to
sting you with not caring but he is the one who taught you to play
football and takraw, and although Kazem violates you repugnantly in
painful tactile thrashings much worse than Kumpee&#8217;s socks and
sneakers ever did to your olfactory nerves he is the one who saved
you from drowning and being beaten to a pulp by your father.&#160;
Also he probably does genuinely care about family despite his
bombastic proclamations of now being the eldest brother.&#160; He
is the one who stifled the sadistic belittling of you that would
have pulverized your self-esteem to dust had the father and eldest
son been left to inveigh against you incessantly. When you are
financially free and independent you can kill off all three of them
from the present and remember the children they were.&#160; Then,
you won't hate them any longer.&#160; Maybe then you will even feel
love but you will have to kill them off first."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; If only good things beget good things
and bad things beget bad things then, thought Jatupon, there would
be divine order.&#160; Then, the invisible presence of God or the
forces that be would not matter.&#160; Dead or bored as God might
be, still the laws of the land would have been laid out like that
of a deceased founder of a company.&#160; The principles of
Buddhism would be in place and operative.&#160; But such was not
the case.&#160; Kazem was not a devil and he, Jatupon, was not a
saint.&#160; He loved having Kazem's tongue enter his anus prior to
his entrance.&#160; This "priming up" was a pleasure that he was
addicted to have.&#160; Wasn't his resentment of his brother this
evening more from the fact that such pleasure had not been given to
him throughout the day?&#160; Wouldn&#8217;t it have been lovely if
he had been made into a sexual slave 24 hours a day, totally free
from logic?&#160; Somehow, he felt that the mosquito would agree on
this point.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The politician, judging aptly that a
deposit of 20,000 baht would be like asking a pack of dogs to put
the chicken in the refrigerator, had one of his aides escort the
boys to Chatochok Market which had almost everything for their
business (woks, burners, gas canisters, ice coolers, utensils,
glass vegetable shelves, carts, oil, noodles, cabbages, bean
sprouts, tomatoes, meat, cucumbers, and rice).&#160; It was one of
the world&#8217;s largest outdoor markets and Thais always gloated
that everything in the world could be obtained there.&#160; The
purchases were made in double since the senator believed that they
needed more than one joint livelihood and a hungry pack with meager
resources forced into the same struggle for sustenance would foster
acrimony.&#160; He hadn&#8217;t exactly thought that they would be
jumping onto the same prey viciously.&#160; He didn&#8217;t really
have many thoughts about it. He hadn&#8217;t given this issue, or
them, much thought apart from how to best unite and part
benevolently within the space of a week if not sooner. This was
just his assessment of males in general.&#160; He saw males in
action on a daily basis in their debates on various bills.&#160;
These were rich men and yet their lust for sinking their teeth into
prey was great.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He did care up to a point.&#160; He
felt that he had aggrieved them by not attending their
parents&#8217; funeral.&#160; He hadn't wanted the discomfort that
his ex-wife would feel standing beside him again. Being human, he
hadn&#8217;t wanted it for himself.&#160; It would have made him
feel uncomfortable and more out of place being there. It hadn't
occurred to him, then, that she wouldn't attend.&#160; Furthermore,
from what little he believed in Kazem&#8217;s answers to his
questions, he felt that he should have protected these three from
having their parents&#8217; assets sucked up into some unrevealed
bank account.&#160; They had been clinging onto the idea that
ultimately Kumpee would act the part of the oldest brother.&#160;
They had watched him go away without accountability and did this
with hardly a whimper.&#160; The senator could have taken it upon
himself to hire an auctioneer and then could have put the money
into his own account.&#160; He would have given out the money when
wisely warranted.&#160; He hadn't acted responsibly and he
regretted it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jatupon stood by, inert and despondent,
as these purchases so abstract and foreign to his hopes were loaded
off onto a mover's truck.&#160; Despite his wish to survive being
fulfilled, it was the aristocratic life he yearned for.&#160; Only
leisure was life.&#160; A laborer was just movement and
reflexes.&#160; A laborer did not run barefoot through the weeds
and allow the smells to be one with him, transfer the beauty to a
complex style on canvas when the beauty passed through his
complicated mind, or attempt to understand why the pollen attacked
him like a sickness.&#160; He wanted someone to grant him the
honors of placing him in an orange robe, which he felt he was
entitled to have--that special robe not of monks but of the type
that surely belonged to aristocrats.&#160; He wanted leisure to see
the rhapsody of every small movement under the lambency of both sun
and moon.&#160; He wanted to meditate on coruscating city life as
the Buddha of Bangkok.&#160; He wanted to be free of the noodles
that were winding about him tightly and to grasp the leisure that
should be his and no doubt was his in an earlier life.&#160;
Poverty ravaged the mind in desperate acts--the mind ached in one
continual groan for something within or without that might be
sold.&#160; No appreciation of the present moment could be had in
such a state.&#160; He wanted to know the splendor of the veins of
each distinct leaf towering over him.&#160; Still it had been
determined by the powers that be that he would float between the
businesses of the two brothers who would have their separate
livelihoods in different parts of the city.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Still, there was something to be gained
in being so lost from memory and he was inured to being
forgotten.&#160; The baby of the family that he was, he had been
pulled out of a cranky woman tired of having children and
responsibilities.&#160; Nursed and taken care of like any child,
still as the years passed he often felt guilty for being his
mother's burden and his attempt at being his mother&#8217;s little
helper did not engender her appreciation. Forgotten again this
time, he would nonetheless be the instrument that fused the two
carts into a family business and he could get along with both all
right, he supposed. He didn't think that his brothers were so
different than himself: like him, they would work hard and feel
themselves, at times, strangled in noodles.&#160; Suthep would be
seeking an alternative being in video games, snookers, Thai boxing
matches, and movement; and Kazem would seek his being through
sickening carnal releases on his brother the result of an
imagination that could make Jatupon into one rapturous whore or
another, and a propensity to always take things apart, beat on
them, and put them back together.&#160; For Jatupon, his escape
came in his ride of feeling in love (tame as it was for new love),
comic heroes that pulled him into more noble pursuits, and dreams
of an aristocratic life.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; There was a garbled mass of
half-remembered faces that gnarled Nawin&#8217;s thoughts when he
woke up one morning.&#160; No different than noodle workers toward
customers buoying in their brains at the end of the night, he had
to let these myriad faces&#8212;most of whom he had encountered in
high school and at the universities he had attended &#8212;to
gradually subside into forgetfulness. He sat up in bed and rubbed
his forehead.&#160; His mind felt like one whose shoes were trapped
in the coils of fallen barbed wire.&#160; He looked at Porn, this
woman whom he had mentally signed a contract to serve her needs and
she his.&#160; Her hair billowed against her pillow like
feathers.&#160; He thought to himself that she, being a prostitute,
and he actually establishing a relationship with one, were so
different from all other human beings. Maybe they were surviving
hominids. They were definitely a divergent specie of
animal.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; He thought about Songkran Festivals.&#160;
All of his grandparents were deceased early into his boyhood.&#160;
In his family there was no tradition of each relative taking bowls
of water and cleansing the hands of the older family members and
this tradition of offering good luck for the New Year, respect, and
deference had never really embedded itself into his mind as a moral
duty. He had never been Thai. Circumstances had made him into a
hominid. He wondered pityingly about the circumstances that had
maimed and freed her.&#160; He stared at her face with great pain
and pathos.&#160; Tears weltered in the corners of his eyes.&#160;
He did not know what to do with this feeling so he buried it and
made love to her.&#160; She took him in her mouth.&#160; The
quicker and deeper she went the more pleasurable it was. Little did
he care if she choked on it. When he was ready to ejaculate he
pressed her head so that he could penetrate more deeply.&#160; His
body had its cellular knowledge that a quick thrusting and a deep
penetration would be more pleasurably exciting and the excitement
and especially the depth of the penis in the vaginal opening would
cause the male to ejaculate more semen that had a greater chance of
impregnating a female. Such was the primitive making.&#160; When
his savage frenzy had ended he knew the extent of his own
selfishness and was relieved to be exorcized of it.&#160; He felt a
humane sensitivity descend on him.&#160; He knew that of all the
selfish and negative energies that influenced his thoughts, they
were, for the most part, not him. With the exception of times of
sexual frenzy, he was able to find a deep and benign part of his
nature and knew it to be the true Nawin, the artist who drew the
oppressed and had sensitivity to the pains of others, the one who
wanted to enrich Porn and all he knew intimately in truth and
beauty.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Perpetually the same, those of leisure
yearned each year for the halting of time and, in dissatisfaction
gained from comparing themselves to others more youthful, yearned
for a return to earlier times of higher pleasures. But it was the
laboring classes who continued to labor in insentience without
reflection.&#160; They cooked their rice and noodles
ceaselessly.&#160; They clung to their jobs like tiny, sedentary,
clinging salamanders to windows during a storm.&#160; They found
their beings (their minds and the feelings that would be refined
into thought within them) lost to the reflexes of the day. Months
blew away like empty bags skidding on the pavements.&#160;
Evanescent and mutable to their ultimate end, their lives passed by
blandly in dizzying headaches caused by the sun of the weatherless
country during the dry season.&#160; When the rainy season set in
there was the discomfort of leaking and wind-swept canopies, the
lack of customers, and being drenched by the rain; but these issues
were minimized by the fact that varied weather made each of the
days more memorable.&#160; The brothers, transplanted into Bangkok
with a livelihood, continued on as if in Ayutthaya.&#160; Memory of
the uncle&#8217;s unfulfilled promise of a dinner had worn away
like the memory of their parents or the abandonment of Kumpee.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At first Suthep strutted around in his
independence like a dominant rooster but as the months went by the
independence underwent the metamorphosis to loneliness and by 1
a.m. of each early morning, an hour or two after Jatupon would
leave him, Suthep would often feel the chill of adulthood.&#160;
One late night/early morning as the smoke of charbroiled fish and
the steam of rice, noodles, and pork soup rose up the
sweat-profuseness of his face and into his hairnet, he watched a
girl giggle and slurp up her noodles with her boyfriend.&#160; He
imagined all traffic on the streets and sidewalk gone and that
there was just the three of them.&#160; He imagined those customers
leaving unhappily. Then, as they were beginning to walk together,
there was a dispute that intensified to the point where he attacked
her.&#160; He imagined him dragging her by the hair, slapping her
down, and denuding her.&#160; Suthep imagined himself walking over
toward them and watching their canine copulation for a period of
minutes. Then an idea possessed him and he started up his
motorcycle and circled the couple, eventually chasing off the body
that had been forcing itself into her.&#160; He imagined himself
helping the trembling body of the female dress.&#160; He didn't
want to cover her but he did it to comfort her so as to gain her
confidence to obtain a new round of banging that would involve
himself and would last longer than if he were to force another
encounter on her now.&#160; Pleasures that had the potential of
being perpetual were always the best. He imagined that he learned
about her life with contrived sensitivity and with time secured
himself as the being whom she yearned for.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Then the happy couple was again a
reality and he was standing alone in front of his cart.&#160; There
they were at the table slurping their noodles joyfully.&#160;
Adulthood was the maturity to relinquish the rebellion against
society for relegating to one his petty station in life bereft of
the pleasures he sees around him.&#160; Being wise was in realizing
that most of such pleasures were neither good nor beneficial.&#160;
Although Suthep was an adult, he was a bitter man and he bit his
lip in the thought of all the pleasures that were out there waiting
for so many others and not for him.&#160; He resented being such a
lowly clod. After the couple paid for the meal and left he sat at
their empty table and looked out across the cars that veered near a
discoth&#232;que until at last he fell asleep.&#160; For a moment
or two of REM he dreamed of his youngest brother dangling by some
friend from an open window of an appliance warehouse only to have
his shoe slip off in the friend's hand and the body unwillingly
succumbing to gravity with his force tripping off the alarm.&#160;
But unlike what really happened two years ago to Jatupon and a
teenager once they extricated themselves and arrived in the big
city on a bus, he, Suthep, was the friend and when the shoe slipped
off he laughed and ran.&#160; He woke up, shook off his sleep, and
then began washing his dishes in big plastic bowls.&#160; He felt a
loneliness eat up on him.&#160; Each evening it seemed to be
exacerbated.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The next evening he was
struggling in ambivalence on continuing to work or closing
early.&#160; Feeling forlorn and lonely, and yet needing to talk to
Kazem about a decision he had made, he chose the latter.&#160; And
when he arrived near Kazem&#8217;s cart with a hairnet still on his
head Kazem&#8217;s countenance was at first chiding.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have lost
your shirt already,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Suthep took off his shirt, wadded it
into a ball, and threw it at Kazem. Kazem wadded it up and threw it
back. Soon the three, in hairnets, were Thai boxing and laughing
with each other.&#160; The few customers they had were ignored. It
was dereliction of responsibility. It was a hiatus. It was
bantering.&#160; It was enjoyment of each other. It was a bit of
love followed by the sharing of duties.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On that fine evening of
gentility Jatupon was able to leave earlier than usual.&#160; While
the other two brothers washed dishes, wheeled away the cart to a
parking lot,&#160; chained it up to a fence, and took supplies they
couldn&#8217;t lock up into and under the cart back to the
apartment, Jatupon went to Sanam Luang.&#160; Once there, he walked
on the long cobbled oval track; interweaved aimlessly around trees
and pedestrians; and watched the wind animate a bag with absolute
breath and power. The wild, breathing plastic, reminded him of
being--the putative lightning that struck the ocean and caused the
crystallization of elements.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Six adroit teenagers playing a game of
takraw were in a crescent position like the broken face of the
moon.&#160; They hit a bamboo ball back and forth with their feet
and heads in a motion that depicted continuum.&#160; Perhaps they
needed to believe in the continuum of action and being (the random
balls of matter that they were).&#160; Inside the stadium-shaped
park were homeless families lying on their thin sheets of
rectangular bamboo mats and towels.&#160; Above the center of this
football field of dust he saw a few prolonged kite flyers and their
instruments swishing as mad serpents of the open night skies under
gas lamps.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He felt the lifelessness and
perfunctory movements of being a noodle worker further exorcized
from him and became enriched in the freedom of his own
impulses.&#160; Still, he told himself that even though he was
almost as poor and homeless as those strewn about him, he should
not be out here to be possibly robbed.&#160; It was an inherent
defense because, more than fearing robbery, he knew that he would
most likely do anything for money. Also there was a secondary voice
of a cruel conscience that taunted him for being such easily sold
goods even though he had never really put himself up for sale and
had never been bought.&#160; As American as he wanted to be, in
Thailand (even Sanam Luang in Bangkok) there was little chance of
being robbed or murdered. He realized that he wasn&#8217;t really
worried on that score.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He was the same as the visual images of
street life that had come to him earlier that day: dogs that gnawed
through the trash; a man whom he had seen in the middle of the
afternoon holding a tree of hooks attached to small plastic
sandwich bags where water and goldfish dangled within (how his
child cried particularly for the sake of the fish); strangers
pushing against each other in the mad rush to sell something and
improve the lot of their lives; and a blind man who had screamed a
song into a microphone to gain the one baht coins he was begging
for.&#160; Like them, he would do almost anything for survival and
the gaining of a better life that would shake in the pockets of his
pants.&#160; Life was rained on one like rocks thrown at the
emaciated dogs as they scavenged for their food or listlessly lay
in the center of congested sidewalks.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Like those homeless individuals on
their mats, he wanted someone to look into his eyes and confirm his
humanity.&#160; He wanted to hear a voice in the solitude of the
night that would give him hope that life was not entirely random
and that he had an importance.&#160; He wanted to believe in
illusions.&#160; He wanted to believe that the incidents that
happened in one's life were for a good reason and that they were
the iron scaffolding that built up his life into one monumental
edifice which would go on and on.&#160; And yet if his family
didn't care to deceive him into seeing connections and
connectedness in random events and time, no stranger out there
would be benevolent enough to attempt the task.&#160; He was a
rotting organism there to be trodden on like any insect.&#160; He
sat on a bench and reread the earlier part of his Laotian poem: the
queens' prayers; the youngest queen&#8217;s pregnancy; the oldest
queen&#8217;s plot foiled by reality stranger than the plot; the
birth of the bird; the exile; the growth as a boy in the shape of a
bird; the growing independent striving of the boy-bird and the
longer flights away from home; the princess who saw the bird and
wanted it...</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Who are you?" asked a girl who was
around his age. Jatupon felt nonplused.&#160; Beauty and truth were
extracted from him.&#160; He was forced out of himself and his
reading like a boy who stared at the light so long that when he
walked away from it he fell into a ditch.&#160; Stupefied, he did
not say anything to the dark skinned glasses-girl.&#160; "I'm
Nappawan Piggy," she continued.&#160; "What are you reading?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "A poem.&#160; It is from Laos."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Are you Laotian?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Not really.&#160; I don't know what I
am."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Why wouldn't you know who you
are?&#160; If you were born here from a Thai mother or father you
are Thai and if you weren't you are a foreigner.&#160; I can't
think of anything simpler.&#160; By the way, your grammar is awful.
It's &#8216;who I am.&#8217;&#160; Not &#8216;what I am.&#8217;
Maybe you are Laotian"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Well, I do. I do know who I am. Maybe
I'm just wishing to not know."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "And you are reading poetry to not
know?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Yes..I...I know its different," he
said with diffidence, "but I'm wanting that."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "You are wanting to become a different
person by reading poetry or poetry will make you someone
different?&#160; Maybe you are wanting to be different than other
people"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "All of the above. Why is your name
Nappawan Piggy?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;It is a nickname.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Nappawan isn&#8217;t really a
nickname, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No, Piggy is.&#160; I got that
from watching too much of the Muppets and Sesame Street when I was
a girl.&#8221;&#160; She laughed.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;People don&#8217;t have last
names as nicknames&#8212;only their first names.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Well this person
does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why not?&#160; I don&#8217;t
like my last name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Well, it has to be the same name
as your parents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Now you understand why my last
name is a nickname.&#160; It would be rather dumb to have two
nicknames.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I can&#8217;t see that I
understand at all.&#160; And no, I&#8217;m not Laotian; and my Thai
grammar is impeccable.&#160; I&#8217;m not stupid.&#160; I am a
self-taught individual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Good for you,&#8221; she said.&#160;
&#8220;They are the best kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He slapped the park bench with
his hand and moved to a corner so that she could sit down.&#160;
She sat there. &#8220;So explain your reason for the last name as
the nickname.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I thought I did.&#160; Well,
I&#8217;ve chosen to make the last name a nickname because it is my
decision to do so; and foremost, I want to be divorced from my
parents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Children can&#8217;t get
divorced form their parents, can they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Watch me. &#8220;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He chortled.&#8220;You are so
honest.&#160; Most Thais aren&#8217;t that way.&#160; Sometimes
they act like servants and sycophants and then talk behind those
people&#8217;s backs.&#160; Sometimes they are scared to say
anything at all like about the kings or anyone higher. You say
everything openly even though you don&#8217;t even know me.&#160;
I&#8217;m beginning to think you are the one who is not Thai.
I&#8217;ve never met anyone like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m one of a kind,&#8221;
she said.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ve never met a poor boy with an
educated head sitting on a park bench before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m one of a kind,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I like people who read something
different and imagine something different.&#160; I hate people who
read comic books and play video games all of the time or buy lots
of things from the malls each day, don't you?"&#160; There was no
answer.&#160; He had trouble denouncing these items that seemed to
him so alluring although already his rash flood of feelings
prematurely told him that she was the best thing that had happened
to him while living in Bangkok and he didn't want to destroy an
emerging friendship with honesty. After all, at present he had no
friends. "Aren't you going to ask why I'm out here?"&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; He couldn't let it be shown that he was
feeling scared to speak for fear of saying something that would
make her turn away from him. He didn&#8217;t realize that his
vulnerability could be read from his countenance and the sweat that
was beginning to come from his forehead.&#160; "Well, why are you
out here so late?&#160; Are you a homeless orphan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; She laughed.&#160; "Listen, funny guy,
see the pendant on this 14 carrot gold necklace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes, I do.&#160; Maybe you
should take that off.&#160; It would be safer.&#160; Put it in your
pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said
diffidently.&#160; She took off the necklace and stuffed it into a
pocket.&#160; &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said.&#160; She paused
and then went on.&#160; &#8220;I have parents and they are very
rich.&#160; I live in a nice home.&#160; I'm just running away from
it. I'm running away from them. You have a kind face but you should
wash it more often.&#160; I see a pimple."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "So.&#160; I've got oily skin.&#160; It
doesn't mean I don't wash it. Now it's my turn to give a question
to you.&#160; Your parents did something that upset you.&#160; You
are running.&#160; From what?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I wish I could slip into your
poem."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "It can't happen but if you read it you
can let the poem slip over you.&#160; That's better really because
that way you don't slip away at all but just put on some modern
armor.&#160; It is like feeling invincible--like slipping on a
soldier's uniform and strapping on a new gun."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I like that idea. That is beautiful.
What's the book about?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "How a prince born as a hawk changed
into a man through love and atonement.&#160; I've read it
before.&#160; Here."&#160; He gave her the book although he
hadn&#8217;t completed the poem itself but only the preface.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "You won't read it again?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "No."&#160; He lied.&#160; He wanted
her to like him. He wanted to give her something so that she would
remember him.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Did you know that my father owns three
factories and is a high official in the government?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "How would I know that?&#160; I just
met you." He felt that it was strange that someone so dark should
have parents who were entrepreneurs and high government officials.
He also felt that it was strange that she should think that he
would know her so deeply. Still, their conversation seemed to him
so uniquely intimate like long established friends.&#160;
&#8220;Here&#8217;s a pen and the book.&#160; I want you to write
your name and address on the front cover.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Okay." He took her pen and wrote it
there.&#160; She took back the book.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Jatupon Biadklang.&#160; No
email address?&#8221; she asked.&#160; He didn&#8217;t understand
much about such things.&#160; He just said &#8220;No&#8221; and
shrugged it off as if it lacked importance. In his heart, however,
he wanted to ask her questions about this technological age.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Then the girl said goodbye and went
away.&#160; He did not understand this needy feeling suddenly
brewing within him that yearned for the presence of another to
stitch his open wounds.&#160; He wanted her to come back to him and
he waited there on that bench for an additional hour with that one
thought dominant in his mind and a foolish expectation that she
would come back to converse with him further even though neither of
them really knew the other.&#160; Still, when he eventually left,
he felt hope in something within his disappointment that she hadn't
returned.&#160; He wasn't quite sure what the nature of this
hopefulness was. Like lightning flashing once to which the
unaccustomed eye blinks twice it pierced darkness and restored
faith in forces beyond mortal knowledge.&#160; Like the refracting
rays of the sun coruscating at 5:00 onto the Chao Phrya River in
round wild and random organisms of light before motor-gondolas and
barges, so he felt that something brief but beautiful had happened
to him and that the residue of it would always stay with him.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Born in boredom and anguish at
seeing snow fall while doing her dishes in front of the kitchen
window, delivered meals, disposable plates, and throw-away
silverware of plastic came into being.&#160; They had seemed at
first to her the perfect tools to minimize discontent.&#160; Then
she kept the drapes shut at all times to keep from seeing the snow.
Still it did not help; and one evening she beat on his locked
studio door and screamed to it that she was going to her language
class.&#160; She hadn&#8217;t been there but once following her
enrollment.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; While she went out with the snow and
the wind, Nawin still remained locked away but free in his
colors.&#160; They flowed in tight brushstrokes of an earthy
tone.&#160; They were of French-Canadian mannequins performing
their perfunctory duties of marriage.&#160; A summary setting of a
banquet table was under the window.&#160; A profuse ochre sunlight
poured through the window permeating the scene at the wedding
banquet.&#160; The table cast a shadow that inundated around the
feet of the mannequins like a pool providing the scene with form
and volume.&#160; However, greatness was in the details and that he
was still lacking.&#160; He was listening to Thai news from his
computer.&#160; The anchorman said that Moslems and Hindus were
burning houses in one Indian community.&#160; Hindus were throwing
Moslem children into bonfires, telling them they would meet their
deceased fathers.&#160; His pastel colors began to have a fiery
gray bleakness.&#160; He felt great despair.&#160; He wondered why
in the 3 million years of Australopithecus through the 100,000
years of his specie (if his specie was to some degree related to
Australopithecus) humans had not learned love.&#160; They had
learned speech and social skills for society to exist but they
hadn&#8217;t learned love.&#160; He wondered if this word was
totally empty without substance. Maybe it was a make-believe word
to make humans feel better about themselves. He wondered if there
was anything outside of human selfishness.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He had once gotten out of
noodles--Noodles stirred in a wok or alive, like worms, in a
vat.&#160; Briefly, he had gotten out of his boyhood assignments of
washing bowls in tubs, being the seamstress attaching jasmine
flowers into rosaries from a long, thick needle, selling them on
the streets in the traffic, and then returning to wash more bowls.
There was a time when his aunt had had mercy on him and had come
into his life despite the inauspicious marriage that her sister had
made. It almost seemed like a dream. Hadn't she first enrolled him
in a Bible School class?&#160; Within that class so long ago, from
a lost being of himself, had he not taken a paper image of Christ
and varnished it onto a piece of wood?&#160; Then his aunt let him
dabble in education and gain the full thirst on the new taste buds.
Neurological responses burgeoned and bifurcated within him. Now
this wooden, shiny-faced Christ or the ashes of it were somewhere
in a colossal garbage heap with so much Kumpee had coerced them to
throw away or sell "to have as savings." That image of Christ or
the conceptualization of it in his head had not spared either
himself or it from the trash heap.&#160; He was, nonetheless, fond
of it. Strangely, Bible school for him had been the initial stage
of his education at the temple school. He wished that he had that
plaque to keep forever.&#160; If he were to have that plaque now it
might be precious proof that a young scholar had actually
lived.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This part of him was undeniably gone.
Gone it was, for he continually slid out of his skin so fully and
naturally even though he was rarely cognizant that this continual
sliding away from himself was taking place.&#160; He was just
slumbering as all slumbered. This was life, and unlike a movie,
music did not accompany it's plotless plodding of time. The sliding
out of his skin happened every minute of his life and yet there was
perhaps some consistency one might isolate as a Jatupon if one were
to imagine such a being when Buddhism stipulated that the self was
nothing but a delusion.&#160; Whenever he saw an emaciated dog
wadded into itself like crumbled trash or sprawled out onto the
pavement as if dead he would always say, "poor baby dog."&#160; It
was a long embedded sensitivity that he had developed in Ayuttaya
from early boyhood. In Bangkok where they seemed even more
pathetic, the sensitivity was exacerbated and he repeated this
phrase over and over again no different than when he was six years
old. This was surely proof of a bit of a consistent self.&#160;
Friends always went away after they learned, shared, or enjoyed the
company of a given person for they needed to evolve to the next
level and forget previous levels.&#160; However, one surely did not
lose himself completely.&#160; He did not know.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Still he was changing and within
the darkness that was subjugating him into doziness a new embedded
consistency was formulating. His mind kept flitting back to the
thought of this girl, Nappawan, and his imaginative curiosity
invented a mansion where she no doubt resided. He could imagine her
governess and feel how contained and alone she might be within a
rigid schedule of private teachers and tutors. He imagined her
accompanied by servants while her continually busy parents remained
remote and detached from her life.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He was as happy to be returning to his
sordid smelling cell as that time when he had returned from the
fair.&#160; With hairnet as a tail in his back pocket, his eyes
gleamed of hope, and curiosity brewed about Nappawan.&#160; Change
also marked the life of Suthep, who was sitting on two bags of his
clothes, latent with the night, when Jatupon approached the
apartment building.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; "What are you doing?" he asked.&#160; Suthep
was smoking near a tree.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I got an apartment. I&#8217;m about
ready to leave.&#160; I thought I&#8217;d tell you goodbye but
maybe get you to help me with a bag if you don&#8217;t mind."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "You're leaving?" He felt
nonplused.&#160; His senses tingled and throbbed in confusion like
the onslaught of the mosquito when drugs had conjured illusions and
excavated buried, opaque truths.&#160; &#8220;If you want to leave
us, why were we all working together earlier today?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;For old time&#8217;s sake.&#160;
I&#8217;m not leaving completely--just from time to time when I'm
tired and want to be able to sleep without having to come all the
way back here."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "What does Kazem say about this?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "What he says doesn't matter.&#160;
What does it matter what he says?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I guess none but I want to know."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Suthep paused.&#160; He wasn't
accustomed to confessions in the confessionals of tree branches. He
sighed and spoke with begrudging reluctance. " I&#8217;ve explained
this to him for months.&#160; He has told me many times that he
wants me to stay here.&#160; He always gets angry whenever I talk
about it. Now I've stopped talking and am doing it, aren't I? No,
he does not want anything to interfere with his notion of what big
brothers ought to do. He acts like he is a lot older than I am.
Anyhow, he is obnoxious: always dropping by my business when he
can&#8217;t catch me here pretending to be concerned that I might
need something.&#160; Most of those times he was just trying to
persuade me that we need some type of joint savings.&#8221;&#160;
He coughed a deep chronic continuum that shook his body.&#160; He
was of an average build but seemed to Jatupon as gaunt and sickly
at such moments.&#160; &#8220;I laugh at his face each time he does
that.&#160; I&#8217;ve been there, done that.&#160; Kumpee made us
saps enough."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "After Mother and Father's death we
were stunned."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Maybe.&#160; Maybe or just believing
that only bad things would happen which is probably about right.
Anyhow, I&#8217;m more or less gone.&#160; You both should be
thankful to be rid of me so that you can carry on without being
witnessed.&#8221;&#160; He laughed.&#160; &#8220;Go ahead and look
innocent and confused.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I don&#8217;t know what you mean."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;About looking innocent and
confused?&#8221; asked Suthep in a chuckle.&#160; He also wanted to
keep the conversation murky.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;About any of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;"Good, stay that way.&#160; None of us
want to know anything&#8212;least of all me. Here, you can help me
by taking a bag.&#8221; As Jatupon reached for a bag he uncorked
his flatulent gas.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "How disgusting!&#160; Are you
going to fart all the way up there?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Where is your
apartment?&#8221; asked Jatupon, anxious that the subject be
changed.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You need to have a doctor
check you out with all that farting you do&#8221; said
Suthep.&#160; He was enjoying Jatupon&#8217;s embarrassment.&#160;
&#8220;A fart doctor,&#8221; he said.&#160; They both
laughed.&#160; They began walking down the soi to the main street.
Suthep smoked and coughed.&#160; His face cringed and then he spat
out some mucus in front of a 7-11.&#160; He buried it with the sole
of his sandal.&#160; They began walking again.&#160; Jatupon was
feeling even more reluctant to experience change and this
reluctance spoke to him in the scraping shuffle of their talking
sandals.&#160; Jatupon did not know what his brother knew and his
mouth opened a couple times as if wanting to ask him.&#160; Still,
he could not speak such things.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "How much is your rent?" he asked at
last as the two of them waited for a period of minutes for a bus.
He was anxious to wedge them out of the coffins that buried each of
them separately into themselves.&#160; Only words and actions were
his crowbar.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Just a thousand" Suthep grumbled. But
from there the journey was a wordless void.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Before they arrived at the smaller cell
Suthep bought a couple cartons of beer from a convenience store and
the two of them sank into themselves within the barren room.&#160;
Exhaustion stung them and yet both, wishing to find a chamber of
themselves not mandated by work and sleep, let the liquor and
marijuana smoke toss about their beings--beings that were sprawled
on pillows on the tileless wooden floor.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Suthep stared at him so directly for a
period of seconds with a face that looked like his aunt when she
had peered out at him from her glasses.&#160; His stare seemed
incessant and those eyes burned his face that blushed from the
worry of what the stare and the invitation to visit here all
meant.&#160; His aunt&#8217;s stare through her glasses had long
ago been like a version of the sanphraphun, the dollhouse of the
spirits that was often placed in front of businesses and
residences.&#160; At such sanphraphuns Thais put down plates of
food and lit incense that would carry to the gods their
wishes.&#160; She had been his guardian spirit in a sanphraphun of
those glasses and yet she had abandoned him. Like the aunt,
Suthep's eyes were probing.&#160; In the smoke of the cannabis he
too seemed like a spirit.&#160; Suthep&#8217;s gaze attempted to
measure the traces of manhood that were in the youngest
brother.&#160; They attempted to not be repulsed by the boy, the
victim, that still surfaced.&#160; Suthep noticed that even in the
masculine activity of beer drinking Jatupon sipped the beer in
little suctions like the infant to its bottle.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Go ahead, little man, swallow as much
as you can in one gulp."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Why?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Why not?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I'm not so little.&#160; We're nearly
the same age and I'm taller than you."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Age and height don't make one
big.&#160; It is experience, and you are lacking experience."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Lacking experience in what?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "In what?&#160; In everything.&#160; In
women, in outlook, whatever.&#160; You're a child."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "And you dragged me here to tell me
that?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I didn't drag you.&#160; You are
making yourself the victim again."&#160; Suthep chuckled.&#160;
Jatupon avowed the truth of this with a smile.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "You make it sound like Mother and
Father defended me as the baby boy" he half joked.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Well, Kazem took up that role when we
were out to beat you senseless."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Don't you ever want to return?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Return where?"</p>

<p>Jatupon swallowed in larger sips while his head was like a boat
swiftly churning its propellers but going nowhere.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "To what we were. Like when we were
able to finally afford a restaurant and Mom would come with Kumpee
in the taxi and they would slide sacks and boxes of vegetables,
rice, and pork that we would put away enthusiastically; or when we
ordered a plastic ball from box tops of cereal boxes like the one
that we spent months getting...the spacey one with many suction
cups...it would stick to about anything when wet; that one Sonkran
where we were in the back of a pickup truck with a barrel of water
for ammunition, aiming at every moving target.&#160; Father had
rented a truck to pick up something.&#160; I don't remember
what.&#160;&#160; But then, for some reason, he changed his mind
and took us..."&#160; They both sank into their father's rare
episodes of kindness and then their minds switched to the pure fun
of Songkran chaos where society became freer and fragmented to
thoughtless instinctual responses of guerrilla warfare where aiming
guns for the open windows of busses and targeting other rival gangs
had no consequences.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I am a man now.&#160; I don't want to
hear bullshit about returning back.&#160; What good does it do to
be sentimental, anyhow?&#160; Chance took them and if they are
looking down on us it will be with as little concern as when they
were alive. As I see it, whether we honor their jars of ashes at
the temple or spit on them it doesn't much matter.&#160; Their
spirits didn&#8217;t keep Kumpee from running off with what he
could. Do I want to return back?&#160; Back wasn't any good either;
so, no, not really if I were to be honest about it."&#160; Only the
high he was experiencing allowed him to be so honest.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Anxieties began to wreak Jatupon's
sensitivities.&#160; The rag of a drape hanging against the window
in a knot looked like a gigantic condom.&#160; There was a huge
hole in the wall symbolic of life being a void. His brother was a
person whom he was beginning to know well at one moment and a
stranger with a strange face reminiscent of an aunt, dreamed or
real, the next moment.&#160; He thought how odd it was that the
whole perspective of someone he had known his whole life was
interchanging so randomly with the worst moments being when his
brother seemed to have a stone alien countenance.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He let another golden wave hit
his tongue.&#160; It was like being hit by a wave from an ocean all
bitter and suffocating.&#160; He began to laugh.&#160; He couldn't
help it. Pains and pleasures seemed to him as such an irrelevant
and comical absurdity slapping a person around in its
inundations.&#160; One moment he would be here and happy and then
he would be there and miserable. He drank more of the beer and
laughed.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Chug it all down!" repeated his
brother.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He thought to himself that here they
were-- two very young men who had once run freely together through
puddles on the streets and yet despite their history (regardless of
it not being a particularly close relationship) Suthep and all that
should seem him was tenuous and frothy when it should be solid in
his memory.&#160; Staring at him for a couple seconds, somehow he
couldn't believe that someone who said "Chug it all down" was his
benefactor.&#160; He looked down.&#160; As he did so, he sensed
that the bubbles were increasing in his can of beer.&#160; The
mosquito, that had been folded, spread out its large mass once it
climbed out of the beer can.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I don&#8217;t want to be lectured to
by you,&#8221; said Jatupon in his mind to the mosquito.&#160;
&#8220;I might want an education but not some garbled ideas of an
insect created by my own inebriated brain."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You get what you pay for. These
opportunities of hearing me on my soapbox is as much truth as any
noodle worker will be exposed to."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I know you are horrible but I don't
mind it anymore. I'm not scared of it anymore. I'm used to it. If I
can&#8217;t get rid of you, at least you will no longer upset
me."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "So quickly you people acclimate and
adapt to rough ways.&#160; How have you been?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He felt stunned.&#160; How good it was
to hear those words. "Okay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Is the job going
okay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;It is the same old
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Don&#8217;t you feel proud
being there enslaved to the needs of higher classes than
yourselves&#8212;especially when they are rather lowly to come to
you to begin with?&#160; All of these department store workers and
so forth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s all
right.&#160; I don&#8217;t know any better.&#160; I want to know
why you like blood."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "A bold childish inquisitiveness
without considering order or propriety. You really aren't
afraid.&#160; You are getting bolder by the day in a more childish
way.&#160; Why do you like chocolate?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I don't know.&#160; I just do."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "But why do you think that you like it
so much?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I wouldn't know."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "You can guess if you follow your
instincts.&#160; If you follow your instincts they will take you
into prehistory when the sweet taste buds formed for succulent bone
marrow.&#160; Which came first: the taste buds for what was sweet
or the experience tearing into bone marrow?&#160; For the answer to
that question you don&#8217;t need a PHD.&#160; You just need to
follow your instincts and they will let you know everything."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I guess people in the past were often
desperate for nutrients and found that they could survive by eating
bone marrow. Nature began to instill man with a taste for that
which was sweet so that he would more likely eat bone marrow when
in a desperate situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Excellent.&#160; In answer to your
question, maybe the boredom of flying around this rocky planet
causes us to need to bite into something deeper.&#160; Anyhow, I
came to find out how you were doing financially now that you have
employment"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "We don't need to worry about staying
alive."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "What more can you expect from life
than that?&#8221;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Jatupon!"&#160; There was a
pause. "Jatupon!"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "A le nah? (what is
it?).</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "You are fading off completely,"
said Suthep with a grimace.&#160; "I think you need to get the hell
out of here.&#160; Your lover&#8217;s waiting for you.&#160; Thanks
for helping me bring some of this junk."&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Chapter 9</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Nawin fell asleep in the suds of his
bathtub and when he woke up his thoughts were frothy. Melancholy
dripped from the shower nozzle and from time to time hit his head
(the contents of which emulated the slow and sad repetition of the
dripping).&#160; A year earlier it had been in such a bathroom at
an artsy party at a friend&#8217;s house near Silpakorn University
that he went away from the crowd to sit on the edge of the tub and
weep with the fatuous wrestling of personal pain.&#160; Noppawan
came into the bathroom to find out what was wrong. She sat on the
edge of the tub next to him and heard about the crash of the United
Airlines jet. Without words she took one of his hands. Without
trying to absorb the sadness of his face in the emotion of
sympathy, he could tell that she was imagining details beyond his
relationship with his deceased uncle or the explosion of the plane.
Seated there, quickly overcoming personal loss in favor of a more
philosophic stance, he believed that America was a self-centered
bully and the Moslem world would continue to attack her for being
so opulent in a famished world, controlling world policies without
giving smaller nations a voice, cuddling the Zionist entity of
these self-professed &#8220;Chosen people,&#8221; and for having
the dominant culture of individual freedoms that went contrary to
their Islamic tyrrany. The couple looked out into nothingness with
similar thoughts.&#160; Both knew the naturalness of hate in
recreating civilization and that destructiveness in society was no
different than the kinetic universe as a whole.&#160; Both knew
that only hope came in recoiling in one&#8217;s passive
intellectual pursuits. At that time he felt sick like when one
hadn&#8217;t eaten for days: people who should have been important
and salubrious spun around in his head as hollow as all the
others.&#160; Only his uncle, a man who did not love him and had no
particular self-interest in the boy had saved him. Only Nappawan,
during his time of mourning, kept him from complete despair.&#160;
He wiped off his hands and arms and made his call on the telephone
as his body leaned stiffly to the edge crushing through frothy
embankments of his bubble bath.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Piggy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Piggy, is that you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes, Nawin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Piggy, I feel tongue tied
here.&#160; This shouldn&#8217;t be a question a husband poses.
I&#8230;I don&#8217;t know what to say.&#160; We are married
technically. Technically, and emotionally from my standpoint, that
is the case so as a husband don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;d be
curious when my wife is going to start making love to
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I have, Nawin, but there
isn&#8217;t much I can do with us on different sides of the
planet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Well, you should be here and she
shouldn&#8217;t.&#160; I asked you to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;And I said that I had
papers to grade and research to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I understand all of that.&#160;
Nobody is to blame.&#160; I&#8217;m not even talking about
that.&#160; I&#8217;m talking about three times before we got
married.&#160; 2 &#189; times afterward. We&#8217;re newlyweds. I
need for you to need to smell my feet, massage my back, do womanly
things I can&#8217;t talk about on the telephone.&#160; I need
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; She thought to herself that
appetites were not the substance of memory.&#160; She wanted to
lecture him but only muttered,&#160; &#8220;Did Porn leave
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No, she is here.&#160; But that
is not the point.&#160; The point is figuring out if you will ever
need me like a wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;The way Porn does?&#160; Honey,
she is a businesswoman.&#160; I&#8217;m sure she enjoys you
immeasurably but you would go broke paying for both of
us.&#8221;&#160; She laughed. She was fully amused by herself; but
then she noticed that she had caused him to retreat in
silence.&#160; &#8220;Hello?&#8221; she said uneasily. She picked
up the poetic story, Thao Nok Kaba Phuak (The Nightjar) that was on
her bookshelf. She opened the book, which had his name and address
on it when he was 14 years old and her name since he had dedicated
the book to her.&#160; Her fingertips caressed the illustration of
the Nightjar on the cover page.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m here.&#160; You
continued to encourage me to have my relationships after we were
married.&#160; It was crazy but I went along with it.&#160; I
thought it was a game: playboy artist encouraged by his wife to
continue to draw saddened whores. I even went to the airport with
Porn thinking you would come there and stop us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Surprise, surprise!&#8221; she
said.&#160; She laughed lovingly.&#160; &#8220;Men explode,
Nawin.&#160; They get it out of their system for a few hours but a
woman percolates romantically throughout the day.&#160; She loses
all sense of reason. She does everything for the sake of that
relationship.&#160; She loses herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;So&#8212;no one wants to reason
24 hours a day.&#160; You can&#8217;t think that people get married
to stop sexual intercourse.&#160; If that was your idea I wish that
you had told me before we got married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220; Nawin, the reason I married you
was not to percolate nor was it to be a recipient of your
explosions when you can&#8217;t get any temporaries to service you.
I realize that temporaries are more erotic than wives, Nawin, the
same as temporaries are probably more erotic than husbands.&#160;
Anybody new will not be like stinking socks kicked off under the
sofa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Is that what I am?&#8221;&#160;
He remembered the stench of Kumpee. She couldn&#8217;t have chosen
a more grotesque image.&#160; He again felt like the ugly dark
skinned Jatupon with his pimples.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You understand what I
mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you at
all.&#160; I don&#8217;t understand what we are, honestly.&#160; Do
we even have a relationship?&#160; Do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Of course, we&#8217;ve known
each other forever. We&#8217;re just trying to figure out some new
movements&#8212;our own ways of behaving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I just want us to behave like
normal couples do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Both of them were silent, digging deep
into their brains for memories of what normal families and normal
couples did.&#160; They couldn&#8217;t find what they were
seeking.&#160; Both exhumed half-dead children of themselves whose
eyes were blinded by pain and too much exposure to darkness.&#160;
What did they know of families, couples, and what normal people
did?</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;We have a relationship but it&#8217;s
a peculiar thing.&#160; It is one of those rare finds based on
understanding and admiration.&#160; One great thing about you that
I admire is that, despite your moral turpitude, I don&#8217;t have
to worry that you will someday become a bitter old man who hates
life.&#160; Bitter old men, Nawin, tend to be that way because they
resent young men off having pleasures when they can&#8217;t engage
in them any longer.&#160; You have your art, your permanent window
on the world. You aren&#8217;t just wasting your life on the next
thrill&#8212;I mean not completely. You&#8217;ll have something to
show for your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I need intimacy with my
wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Isn&#8217;t what I&#8217;m doing now
intimacy?&#8221; she spoke with a bit of anger. &#8220; Isn&#8217;t
going to an art museum even a higher intimacy?&#160; Isn&#8217;t
being an artist or in my case sharing my research on zoology to a
conference intimacy at its highest degree. You&#8217;re ignorant
but you aren&#8217;t stupid.&#160; You&#8217;re not even so
ignorant: just a victim of too much testosterone clouding over your
senses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I need tender love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Tender love isn&#8217;t in a
man&#8217;s lexicon. You think you need women to be tender enough
to let you bang away on them. Pleasurable banging, and one or two
women as your permanent trophies: that&#8217;s your
need.&#160;&#160; I don&#8217;t think it is much of a need. Wanting
the right people is good.&#160; Needing them
isn&#8217;t.&#8221;&#160; She paused and waited but his voice was
not forthcoming.&#160; &#8220;Nawin, are you still
there?.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m still here. Piggy, you
haven&#8217;t contacted me in weeks. I was beginning to think that
you were filing for divorce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160; &#8220;The line was too large at the lawyer&#8217;s
office&#8221; she joked. He chuckled.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Are you okay, Piggy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m fine, Nawin.&#160;
Thanks for finally asking.&#160; &#8220;How are you and Porn? How
are your classes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;The class on the influence of
Caravaggio is useful.&#160; All of the classes are fine. Noppawan,
I think that Porn hates being with me now. I think she is
disappointed being here with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m too busy to take her
wherever she wants to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Where does she want to
go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I think anywhere but
here&#8212;New York mostly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go?&#160; It
is just a day&#8217;s journey, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he
sighed.&#160; &#8220;Piggy, I&#8217;ve tried to call you twenty
times.&#160; Why are you at your sister&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Oh, Nawin, that is a good
question.&#160; You know how the landlord let four Chinese students
rent out an apartment near us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;Do you remember that we always
heard that sizzling sound of them frying food in their
woks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes, so&#8212;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Well, they fried most of the apartment
building.&#160; The sprinklers didn&#8217;t turn on. No one was
hurt fortunately.&#160; You had only a few canvases.&#160; I took
out your paintings and my computer and ran out before the flames
reached our door.&#160; Our ideas are safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Thank God!&#160; Thank God, no
one was hurt.&#8221;&#160; He imagined the horror of having all his
canvases in that location and his image emblazoned in light, heat,
and smoke.&#160; What a way of setting his reputation on fire. What
a way of enlightening the world.&#160; And yet, in accordance with
Zen, burnt canvases would nip his ego and remind him of the true
traceless aspect of being.&#160; If this had happened, to which his
whole being poured out praise to whatever forces of the cosmos
intentionally or unintentionally caused it to not occur, it would
have taught him the awareness that permanence was an illusion. It
would have taught him an acceptance of fate and an appreciation of
the simple pleasure of just being. He thought of the time that he
and Noppawan were in a Songkran Festival water fight in
Banglampool.&#160; Both were unlucky enough to have both sides of
their faces shot with water containing some form of caustic
chemicals that burned lacerations which later changed into black
eyes.&#160; For a few weeks the friends had been freaks but then
they were always freaks, and at the age of 14 or 15, the inception
of their friendship, they had attended the natural science freak
museum at Siriaj Hospital.&#160; In Thailand no one told the
truth.&#160; They were careful and obsequious with their
&#8220;wei,&#8221; their traditions, and their buried
tongues.&#160; They were in favor of just getting along.&#160; To
Thais, he and Piggy would be perceived as intractably
strange.&#160; The couple couldn&#8217;t claim to be comfortable as
freaks although freakishness was their natural order.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Also, the monkey, the cat, and the
parrot: I got them out too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Noppawan?&#160; Noppawan
Rongthang&#8221; he said timidly in the fog of self-doubt.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Jatupon Biadklang&#8221; she
mocked him and laughed at his insecurity.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you move into
the condominium?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;My sister&#8217;s apartment is
near the university.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling lonely,&#8221;
he said while laughing at himself.&#160; &#8220;I love you but
I&#8217;m doubting if you love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Feelings come and go,
Nawin.&#160; We have a commitment to each other as friends and
we&#8217;re married.&#160; The way I look at it that is more stable
than what most people have.&#160; There is me and there is you and
from those two important things we create us.&#160; Where&#8217;s
Porn at now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;She went to her language
class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Oh, is she now trying to learn
Thai?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He laughed victoriously choking on his
saliva.&#160; He coughed. &#8220;You are jealous!&#8221; he said
gleefully.&#160; You do love me.&#160; You are jealous out of your
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Dream on, Nawin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Piggy is jealous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;In your dreams,
Nawin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He stopped laughing.
&#8220;Piggy? I want to tell you about something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Are you whining,
Nawin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Well, I was ready to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; She felt that husbands used women to
rape or as confidants for the release of their suffering
boys.&#160; She found it vertiginous and a bit nauseating.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said coldly,
&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I just want to tell you
something that happened&#8230;I think I saw my brother&#8212;one of
them when I was leaving for the airport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;The one who beat up on your face
when I first met you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yeah.&#160; Maybe.&#160;
It&#8217;s nothing.&#160; It is just on my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Did you talk to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No, just saw him from a
distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Hanging up, he got dressed and,
paintbrush in hand, he returned to his dreams: dreams of people in
movements imitated from their fathers and forefathers&#8212;those
in traditional marriages and traditional jobs who were in their
movements as perfunctory and dead as noodle workers.&#160; He swept
color on his canvas.&#160; He made imagined forms of those who had
not, in their early childhood been maimed in this mechanical
apparatus called family.&#160; For selfish reasons, like those tiny
salamanders clinging to windows during a storm, he thought that he
should spend time with Porn, know her in more detail, listen to
her, and understand.&#160; In part he was able to click into that
tender inquisitive probing and non-judgmental listening called
empathy, but the thing that clicked his brainwaves in this
circuitry was often selfish.&#160; He knew that he, his wife, and
his Porn were all maimed ones.&#160; They were indeed a
family.&#160; They were part of him and he did not want to lose
them.&#160; Both brought him pleasurable respites from himself who
was often attuned to the pain that was rife in all things.&#160;
When Porn came home he went to her.&#160; He asked how her day
was.&#160; He listened to her complaints.&#160; He paused and
waited.&#160; He understood her isolation.&#160; Still he did not
promise to take her to New York.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Impermanence was in all things.
Galaxies collided or were pulled into joint oval orbits.&#160;
Planets were sucked into those suns in the realignment. The suns
themselves eventually flared up into supernovas consuming all
planetary bodies orbiting their realm and died. Long ago while the
senator was in his first year of law school his sister had become
one of the hundred women on a given day that sought to get
traveler's visas at the German Embassy escorted by their boyfriends
so as to begin a departure that would keep them in exile. His
parents were now beginning to act the parts of invalids and
leeches.&#160; To his parents he had failed them by being divorced
and not having children that would have fostered the illusion of
continuum. They also thought he had failed them by not inviting
them into his home. The result was a continual stream of their
calls on his mobile telephone where the mother and father diagnosed
themselves and each other, listing all symptoms and proposing
materialistic requests and more time together that would alleviate
or distract their mental and physical suffering. Women whom he had
thought of as having permanent relationships gained new
perspectives from the intake of new information.&#160; They also
gained more immediate and dominant feelings engendered by newer
relationships.&#160; They went on and became something different
without any way of relating back since, like the expanding
universe, it all needed to go forward. With aging parents and
relationships awry came the growing daily awareness of the limits
of his lifespan making him all the more glutinous to have money,
status, and women who could produce for him children.&#160; But
with each year of impermanence his identity of himself fell on its
own weight like a black hole and he did not know whom he
was.&#160;&#160; The loving neediness of wanting that special woman
who would take care of his sexual needs, give him children, and not
extort him of finances with a divorce grated against him
stridently.&#160; There was no security against another mishap
especially at his present age of forty when his physical attributes
were diminishing and a woman would not be likely to marry him for
how he made her feel.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jatupon wanted to be an aristocratic
bum.&#160; He wanted to commune with inner voices within himself
and to have the relationship of green blades of grass firmly poking
into the crevices of his toes when he ran about barefoot in a
park.&#160; He wanted to return to that state of knowing perfectly
what to say when others asked him, at age five, what he wanted to
become when he grew up. "I want to become a tickle-man," he would
always tell them and then he would try to tickle them before they
tickled him. A decade later, this old long-lost game with Kazem in
particular could not be surpassed.&#160; He still couldn't think of
a better vocation than a tickle-man.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Outside of the continual wish to have
an aristocratic life free of the specious ambition to either
sustain himself as a working class slave or by the stretch of his
imagination a CEO slave, a doctor, or a senator, Jatupon&#8217;s
inward feelings were beginning to subtly change away from his love
of his brother, Kazem. His ideas and feelings were shifting toward
impermanence with each letter he received from Noppawan
Piggy.&#160; Finally, he had a friend although for the past few
years Jatupon had virtually had none. As much as new manhood
awakened old instincts deep in cellular memory for the odor, the
touch, the pleasure and the pounding of any type of sexual activity
where the differing force of the thrusts and the stirred waves of
his hormones all whizzed him in a unique frenzy for a brief time,
he yearned more for Noppawan.&#160; He yearned for her ideas and
her
presence.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He considered his need for her one time
as the two brothers lay naked immediately after a sexual encounter
under a ceiling fan that was newly installed.&#160; He watched the
blades chopping through the musty air and in a very minute sotto
voce of his thoughts he yearned for destruction.&#160; He wanted
for the wobbly fan to fall and guillotine his head.&#160; For the
most part, however, sexual acts like this one was his rocket fuel
to Nirvana.&#160; It always brought him into a religious state that
he couldn&#8217;t duplicate in any other way.&#160; That one moment
after his brother's sexual act and his own masturbation, he was
free of wanting anything.&#160; At such times he just lay there
breathing in the oxygen deeply and feeling fully satisfied with
being.&#160; This too he yearned for and only his brother was able
to grant him Nirvana.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At last he had a friend. This
relationship gave him more meaning to the days than even the
rain.&#160; Sustained reflexes as an assistant cook had caused the
days to stumble along on deformed feet so uneventfully after his
parents&#8217; death. Now it wasn&#8217;t so bad.&#160; After the
washed-plate monotony of late evenings he would often pull out of
his back pocket a letter that he had read many times before.&#160;
At both restaurants Kazem and Suthep individually razzed him about
his new girlfriend but they believed that he did not know anyone.
To them the girl had to be some remote villager wanting to learn
about life in Bangkok by advertising for a pen pal in the back of
the comic book pages. On one night of one particularly troublesome
week without a letter he went to sleep from his banal world at an
empty table and dreamed his anything but banal dreams.&#160; Within
Jatupon's sleep there were at first tire swings and butterflies
nestling on succulent flowers but then on the flowers there was the
perfidious couplings of mosquitoes.&#160; He smelt the pheromones
that the male had emitted to make the female believe that it was
following a whole army of male hunters who had procured food when
really there was just that one male poised relaxingly waiting for
the ovulating specimen to come to it's perch.&#160; The female was
as white as Kumpee's Chinese girlfriend and she hated and loved the
guile as much as the deceiver in that unique mix that makes sex
such a delight.&#160; Then, after finishing its frenzy, the
mosquito was back with him.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I don&#8217;t understand this delay in
meeting" he dreamed of himself telling the mosquito.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Still, after nearly four months in
this city, you think that the senator is really trying to fit you
into his schedule of dinner guests and your sweet mother and father
are going to return from the dust."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Something like that.&#160; I
don&#8217;t want to be forgotten.&#160; If Mother and Father are
really dead in the true sense of the word I won&#8217;t be able to
see them again."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Dear me, when are you going to shake
your boyish Thai ways? Being respectful to a couple morons who
accidentally conceived you in their sexual frenzy is too
preposterous.&#160; Regarding death, I can&#8217;t see anything
wrong in just plain death. You kill enough of us when you do your
laundry each week.&#160; I see you emptying out puddle-remnants of
the previous week's water from your plastic buckets where we are
laying our eggs and then pouring in new laundry soap and water. You
attempt to flatten us with the palms of your hands.&#160; You never
seem to consider death such a tragedy in those circumstances.&#160;
I can't see why any being--mosquito or human--would want to
continue on for thousands of years anyway.&#160; A being
continually growing from the same old bud in an environment not all
that conducive to growth becomes as fallow as the world around
him.&#160; So much negativity from all of those disillusioned
experiences withers one in ennui&#8212;I can&#8217;t think of
anything more horrid!&#160; Then comes petty greediness to have
something; and no one is pettier than old men whom you give the
&#8220;wei.&#8221; Thais extend this deference to these beastly
wrinkled beings as if age makes such grumbling, maundering
creatures continually thinking of their mortality and their aches
and pains enlightened beings. I can't see that it would be good to
live forever.&#160; It is better to die off completely and let the
energy come back as something totally different.&#160; This new
being will dance its dance and celebrate the novelty of the world
before adulthood hits him across the face with a mallet."</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When they got home it was sleep again
so that they would wake up with energy and motivation to do more
work. Before Jatupon awakened naturally to the sun-god (the night
having deadened his soul and put him to sleep as any ancient
Egyptian laborer long ago believed of his own life), so Kazem in
darkness came to his startled awakenings with an alarm clock as
well as the alarm of and in his own brain that yearned for
sustenance and more which always came from money.&#160; With no
love oil, and no rimming, he took Jatupon with maximum thrusts
engendering within him the inclination, if not the incitement, for
violence.&#160; Jatupon&#8217;s first thoughts of the morning were
that he wanted to slit his brother&#8217;s throat.&#160; He wanted
to cut off Kazem&#8217;s head, stuff it, and put it on a bookshelf
had they purchased a bookshelf.&#160; It was no wonder, he thought,
that this one had no girlfriends.&#160; Who would care to have one
so large&#8212;so large!&#160; As the lovemaking subsided, it
tossed Kazem back into a nap like the soothing backward movement of
the tide. Jatupon felt that he was bleeding and so he went to the
toilet and sat on the stool feeling beneath him from time to time
to see if there was blood. There wasn&#8217;t any. He sat and sat
virtually thoughtless until the idea returned that he could kill
him.&#160; He wanted to kill him veritably.&#160; He could take one
of the new television sets that Kazem had purchased for he and
Suthep and smash his head while he was sleeping. He could spray
paint the walls with air freshener and light a match.&#160; The
whole room could be set ablaze like a funeral pyre.&#160; He got up
and dressed.&#160; He needed to escape.&#160; He needed to run away
to the street people before his actions matched his thoughts.&#160;
He needed to be with the street people.&#160; He told himself that
he loved them veritably. He scavenged money from Kazem&#8217;s
pants and took a taxi to an abandoned railway station with its
severed tracks where weeds or moss grew a little on&#160; most of
everything and homeless, crippled dogs with one or more smashed
paws found a respite.&#160; He purchased some amphetamines from one
of the street people and, done in sync with his glue, his head
began to spin.&#160; Beethoven&#8217;s Ninth Symphony, which he was
exposed to from a movie on the television earlier that week, played
in his head and the dogs with their mangled paws began
dancing.&#160;&#160; Plaid or corrugated he thought two things
intermittingly as the dogs continued to dance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kazem, when he thought of Kumpee, wanted to twist off his head
like a crawdad&#8212;he who had stolen their money and put them in
this hole.&#160; Then his anger subsided by again recalling a good
thing that had come out of it.&#160; He, as yet, did not have to
pay for rent or utilities.&#160; Also the two of the siblings were
gone allowing him to be liberated.&#160; The idea of being a
teenager free of mother and father had been intriguing to
him.&#160; As much as he mourned the deaths of his parents, their
deaths had seemed to him liberation to manhood and his own sexual
fulfillment.&#160; The same was true of&#160; Kazem and Suthep. He
didn&#8217;t resist Kumpee&#8217;s plan to replant them in the
modern sordid capital of Bangkok.&#160; He sensed all along that
Kumpee would leave them and he didn&#8217;t murmur a word.&#160;
His opposition to Suthep&#8217;s departure was mostly a show. He
wanted to pursue that liberation with impunity.&#160; He went to
work .</li>

<li>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stand the boredom of everything around
me&#8221;&#160; &#8220;But you have to survive,&#8221; said the
mosquito.&#160; &#8220;All animals have to survive.&#8221;&#160;
&#8220;I am declaring a day off.&#160; Besides, when I see you I
can&#8217;t do anything else.&#8221;&#160; &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you
the lucky one?&#8221; said the&#160; mosquito.</li>

<li>Kazem liked how obscure his petty actions were in the
city.&#160; No matter what one did here it was obscure.&#160; Here
no one pretended to care&#8212;so absorbed they were in making sure
that their own sordid activities were kept inside that they
didn&#8217;t need to feign being shocked or to gossip about human
anomalies all which were as old as the specie.</li>

<li>&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you sitting.&#160; You are just leaning
against the building, staring across severed train
tracks.&#8221;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m in pain.&#160; I can&#8217;t
sit.&#8221;</li>

<li>Long before light or orange robed monks made their alms he
hauled his cart from a lot where he stored it for a fee.&#160;
Hauling it on the edge of the street like any other hapless ones,
occasionally he met gaunt dogs, salesman of real stores helping the
deliverymen get their produce off the trucks and dragging the boxes
to the sidewalks, ice-cream salesman on tiny bicycle-driven stores,
and the glass aquarium fruit cars with their gravel of ice that
other hapless ones pushed along the street; and from it all it was
hard to feel alone.&#160; Sound and motion beat off the cruel
static morbidity of his own thinking that had the compunction of
criticizing him for his actions with the youngest brother and saw
no future outside of monthly drunken vigils with fellow restaurant
workers and those rare occasions when he went off with Suthem to
ladies of the night he paid for.&#8212;is he thinking about me,
thought Jatupon.&#160; &#8211;as he sets up the restaurant, is he
thinking about me?</li>

<li>&#8220;And taking that makes you feel less blue?&#8221;&#160;
&#8220;At least less alone.&#8221;&#160; &#8220;Maybe you are an
addict.&#8221;&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. It is
recreational.&#8221;&#160; &#8220;Sounds like a venereal
disease.&#160; It sounds American.&#8221;</li>

<li>He liked being unmonitored.&#160; Sure, there was adrenalin
gained from the hunt of a woman but more came from the more
forbidden pleasures. A man with money was more alluring to a female
who needed this more vehemently than sperm for the making of
offspring.&#160; What did he have to give a woman.&#160; He had
dated before.&#160; He was big.&#160; It fascinated but repelled
them.</li>

<li>&#8220;I told you.&#160; I was feeling blue; and I like how the
world turns around like a carousel of caricatures when I mix the
glue and the pills.&#160; Tracks, dogs, and the old abandoned
railway station seem to be breathing.&#160; I don&#8217;t have
anyone else.&#160; Sometimes I like hearing from you.&#8221;&#160;
&#8220;How kind!&#8221; said the mosquito stoically.</li>

<li>Suthep&#8217;s apathy had come from the acceptance of something
deeply sordid in himself.&#160; Policemen were paid their paltry
sums and had bigger crimes to corner than family perverts. His was
a business so meager that it retained a tax exempt status by the
nature of no status at all, a business existing with no address
although this oversight was compensated for by a policeman who came
to extort money from Kazem weekly. Being sordid was a type of
wisdom.&#160; From it he was cognizant that such instincts to
conquer sexually were part of the sadistic imaginings of the
creative force or the pragmatic cause and effect that engendered
the floundering of human existence and he wasn&#8217;t hardly the
god for redesigning it all&#8212;especially he who rarely thought
of it as being essentially wrong in theory despite feeling
nominally guilty.&#160;</li>

<li>&#8220;Do you think that he loves me?&#8221;&#160; &#8220;What
definition of love are we using now?&#8221;&#160; &#8220;The real
one.&#160; I&#8217;m older now&#8212;almost 15.&#160; I know.&#160;
Do you think he loves me like someone with a great sickness inside
of him who desperately seeks medication or a yearning to slam
himself into me fully like one entity?&#8221; &#8220;Okay,
I&#8217;ll grant you that one,&#8221; said the mosquito and then it
guffawed.</li>

<li>And so, unchaining the tables from beneath his cart, pulling
out the plastic stools underneath, and kicking away a few sleeping
dogs that were lying there to be tripped over like disheveled rugs,
alone he started his business.&#160; He chatted with those he
encountered and felt the light commotion of an awakening world fill
him with its harmony before routine tasks dominated over him.</li>

<li>His father had tried to squash him.&#160; He was excoriated for
standing, sitting, combing his hair, where he parted his hair, the
food he ate, the meat he abhorred, and the clothes he put on.&#160;
He couldn&#8217;t do anything.&#160; He wasn&#8217;t
anything.&#160;</li>

<li>Stirring a pot of rice deep memories ran by him in glimpsed
ghostly passing stirring up raw negative feelings that created the
hard product of his thoughts.&#160; His father had been an
aggressor at all times who never mellowed any to his death.&#160;
For many early years Kazem&#8217;s ears had been pulled daily.</li>
</ul>

<p>He had been dragged by the hair.&#160; He had been forced to sit
daily on a little red</p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
footstool next to his father as punishment for not only youthful
exuberance</p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
(youth which ran around on two feet whereas he had to flounder with
a cane)</p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
but for the intractable insolence that would interfere with his
punishment of</p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
the two &#8220;suck-calves&#8221; of the youngest brothers whom he
hated.&#160; Kazem still</p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
had the scars of cigarette burns in his brown skin as palpable and
tangible</p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
proof that the man had really existed.&#8212;No, more than
that.&#160; His love for me is</p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
more than just a sickness although it has that in it, said Jatupon
to the</p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
mosquito.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He couldn&#8217;t tell where he
was.&#160; Faces of his parents, Kumpee, the aunt and uncle,&#160;
the monks at the temple school, and that boy he had been friends
with for so many years (the one who had been with him begging in
front of the Dunkin Doughnuts shop and, a couple years ago, had
allowed his feet to slip from an open window that time they had
made their petty attempt into major thievery on that runaway trip
into Bangkok) all were without faces but wandering around like
ghosts in his thoughts. He could see the forms of these people in
his head but only a few of them had the slightest trace of a
face.&#160; He had somehow defaced them.&#160; Time had defaced
them.&#160; Memory was fading. As the hours passed uncomfortably he
became more aware of himself.&#160; He forced himself to be more
rational.&#160; He was hungry and tired.&#160; He wanted to go
home.&#160; He told himself that he&#8217;d kill his brother the
next time he did something like that. And yet, when he was about
ready to be put in jail that time in Bangkok it had been Kazem who
had stolen money from their parents.&#160; It was Kazem who had
paid off a police officer.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Nawin reflected Porn&#8217;s
feelings.&#160; &#8220;So, you don&#8217;t feel purposeful.&#160;
You are in a relationship with a man who spends his time with his
paints leaving you alone in the cold of Canada without feeling
purposeful. You got so sick of washing dishes that we&#8217;ve now
gone to paper plates.&#8221;&#160; He chuckled.&#160; She smiled.
&#8220; I care about you.&#160; I&#8217;m glad you are here with
me.&#160; Regarding purpose, we&#8217;ll work on that.&#160;
I&#8217;ll see if I can get you a job on campus.&#160; I&#8217;ll
definitely stop things from now on anytime you want to talk.&#160;
If you want to go out to a movie, I&#8217;ll go out with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I want to go to New York
City.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;That is something to be
considered too,&#8221; he said evasively.&#160; He changed his
cynical ideas.&#160; It seemed to him that empathy was love.</p>

<p></p>

Chapter 10</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jatupon agreed to
meet her at Siriaj Hospital.&#160; From a bus he took an express
boat.&#160; Seated there, he tried to read the Student Weekly
published by the Bangkok Post but attempts at understanding English
were to no avail.&#160; The sun and wind together shot him with
tranquility darts that took him to an ethereal, unearthly peace
exempt from the conflicts of consciousness but also from assembling
understanding from the fragments of the pieces to the day that came
through his senses in a mosaic.&#160; He wanted to understand his
place in the world.&#160; He wanted to understand the premise of
his life that constituted a compromise of the internal conflicts of
the mind.&#160; But he also wanted peace of mind and he sank in
with his ease until he was asleep.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He woke on the hard orange chair inside
the boat to a splash of polluted water against his face. Once again
he was staring at the waters that gyrated against the boat. He
watched the frothy mist from the motion of the boat arise to the
window-sized glassless hole that was beside him. Again he was in
the world of conflict and for a moment he resented being there as
if breathing and thinking deigned him. His conflict was what he was
doing now.&#160; He was continuing his part as the absent employee
and he worried of the consequences. He thought of going back.&#160;
All he had to do was step out onto any dock and wait for a boat
going in the opposite direction; but his legs were like
stone.&#160; He would not budge. The boat was moving forward and so
would he.&#160; He removed his sunglasses, put his hand into the
water, scooped in a residue of the moisture that did not fall from
his fingertips, and cooled the hot throbbing of the swollen
blackish blue skin beneath his left eye.&#160; He was proud of his
courage.&#160; Four nights ago Kazem had finally given into his
demands for his mail but it had been a calculative maneuver to
mitigate their protracted altercation that had gotten out of
control over his noodle soup/fried rice-truancy.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; His thoughts carried him piggyback at a
gallop.&#160; There were savage impulses amuck in that instinctual
need to dominate in procreation and yet how was it he had let
himself become the one who was ridden on instead of the one
riding?&#160; It was a mystery as to why he should be content to a
role so clearly defying the male instinct to be the sexual
aggressor. Maybe, he half-wondered or felt in some murky and
illusive way that failed to come together as a cohesive thought, it
was from not taking on that masculine pose of one ready to preempt
his own selfish and sadistic impulses onto others for his own
self-gratification.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He wasn&#8217;t addicted to drugs any
more than he was to love, he told himself. &#160;One needed a bit
of both.&#160; He wasn&#8217;t weak.&#160; Except once of clearly
finding himself addicted and being forced to go through
detoxification with some charitable monks (that had been the
cocaine period the result of frequent raids of the cash box and an
episode of thievery in Bangkok), he believed that his mentality was
a strong one.&#160; Of course, until the move to Bangkok, the
family had ensured that for the past two years he was rarely
allowed out of their sight and never came near the cash box.&#160;
This had assisted his lack of addiction.&#160; Even now his
interaction with customers was overseen suspiciously.&#160; And
laboriously friendless as his life droned on (with this new
exception if indeed she cared to really be his friend and he was
anxious that she should be such) he perceived himself as a freakish
aberration to so many boys his age that had normal if not
exceptional lives.&#160; They walked together in
throngs&#8211;schoolboys in their light blue knit shirts and dark
blue shorts walking the streets, entering 7-11s, clustering in for
&#8220;All You Can Eat&#8221; Pizza Hut specials, or walking hand
in hand with girls to the malls.&#160; He half hated them.&#160; He
hated their laughter, which seemed to deride him.&#160; Sometimes
he wanted to hit against the wall that entrapped him.&#160; It was
like he was a Mexican and America had deliberately concocted a wall
to keep him out. If only it were an eggshell, he thought to
himself, he would be able to peck his way out.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And here he was at the
Siriaj pier.&#160; There was a Dairy Queen, and a Black Canyon
Restaurant near the pier and a long winding outdoor market.&#160;
He wondered why she had chosen Siriaj Hospital for their meeting
place and why, given the location, she had not chosen for them to
meet in one of those restaurants.&#160; Instead, he was supposed to
meet her in front of a museum. He meandered in different pathways
throughout many buildings until he noticed her sitting on a stoop
under a sign that said &#8220;Museum&#8221; in English.&#160; Her
hair was shorter than the last time he saw her and her cheeks
seemed chubbier.&#160; She was dressed in her school uniform.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Sunthon Phu, there you
are,&#8221; Noppawan said.&#160; Sunthon Phu was an important poet
long ago who had risen from humble parents to become a private
secretary for King Rama II because of his literary abilities.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8220;Here I am,&#8221; he said. He
smiled glowingly.&#160; There was nothing about it that was
affected. He came nearer to her.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I was worried that you
wouldn&#8217;t get my last letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I got it yesterday in my new
mailbox at the post office&#8221; he said with pride.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Good.&#160; That brother of
yours was really keeping my letters, was he?&#160; What a scoundrel
.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ll always get them from
now on. Do you want to go into the coffee shop?&#160; I can buy our
coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;What happened to
you?&#8221;&#160; She was staring at his left eye.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Oh.&#8221;&#160; He realized
that he had forgotten to put the sunglasses on his face.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I got into an argument with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Over stealing the
letters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220; Is he the brawny one you told
me about before&#8212;the oldest one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Well, then he should be put in
jail for thievery, assault and battery, and being a brawny
moron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I have money. Do you want to eat at
Black Canyon?&#160; You might not want coffee.&#160; I never drink
it.&#160; Just water and cola.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;If we were to eat at Black
Canyon or someplace less dingy-- really elegant-- I&#8217;d make
sure my father paid for it.&#160; We wouldn&#8217;t need
money.&#160; The whole day could be put on a credit
card.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No, as the man, I insist on
paying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Maybe later,&#8221; she first
spoke in irritation.&#160; She wasn&#8217;t interested in his
chivalry. &#8220; I want to go in here now.&#160; Have you ever
been in here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No, what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Do you like museums?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I love learning.&#160;
That&#8217;s all I love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Not just Laotian
poetry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Now you know why you are my
friend.&#160; When I saw you reading on a bench&#8212;and reading
an English translation of a book-- I knew that we would get along
well. This is a special place.&#160; When I run away, I often come
here.&#160; I spend hours not just learning about natural science
but becoming friends with it if that makes sense.&#8221; She took
his hand and led him in.&#160; &#8220;Don&#8217;t be
alarmed,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Things that are beautiful are
often ugly, and what is ugly is often beautiful.&#160;&#160; I like
coming to someplace where everything is true.&#160; I hate lies,
don&#8217;t you?&#160; Even ugly truths are better than
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He thought about what the
mosquito had said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been told that truth is
sometimes a little ugly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I think it&#8217;s always
ugly and beautiful&#8212;not just a little bit.&#8221;&#160; They
climbed up three flights of stairs.&#160; The air in the building
smelled like a biology laboratory during the dissection of
frogs.&#160; They entered: internal organs in glass boxes of
formalin; brains; an ear with a joining canal; and then there was
an entire baby standing there also in formalin and also inside its
large glass aquarium.&#160; The child was hauntingly ceramic in a
grayish orange or ochre complexion and his body was so tightly
rigid.&#160; It had calcificans congenita and, she said, it must
have been born as a non-movable rock.&#160; Then there was a child
that had a gigantic, alien head.&#160; It had suffered from
internal hydrocephalus .&#160; It was all there: babies born with
amencephaly (some with partial heads and all with no brains);
fetuses; four month old fetuses with placentas and umbilical cords
(one with hands together as if it were praying or gesturing the
&#8220;wei&#8221;); fetuses that were zygotic twin quadruplets;
babies born as Siamese and conjoined twins such as pycopasus twins
that were attached from their buttocks and Siamese epionathus
parasiticus that each had a brother&#8217;s foot inimitably in a
mouth; full term fetuses with their chests dissected so that their
internal organs were exhibited from the slit; gigantic skeletons;
dwarf skeletons; twisted adult skeletons; regular skeletons upright
in glass cupboards or in standing coffins each with his photograph
above his skeleton--a photograph of what was; fetuses of all sizes
and ages; and a naked man and woman in whole with the front skin,
muscle and skeleton removed to give full view of their internal
organs as one saw their private exterior organs.&#160; There they
were more than naked and fully in tact as if basking in a tanning
booth in order to get a suntan&#8212;only they were ochre and stiff
as ceramic vases and floating in formalin or formaldeyhyde.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He told himself that that from
which one should hide he should appreciate since it delivered him
from the way he wanted the world to be to what it really was. He
repeated this to himself many times to quell the weltering tremble
of nausea and to hide his horrified child in the presence of
Noppawan.&#160; He told himself that seeing this almost delivered
him to a new level of maturity.&#160; If one could confront this
without losing his nerve, he reasoned, he could break from the
ghosts of mother and father, the innate need for family, and the
wish to be a less damaged &#8220;good for nothing.&#8221;&#160; He
could sense the nuance of manhood begin to brew up through him like
a hot spring. Passing through another aisle of stocked fetuses, he
wondered about his conception.&#160; Had it been from loving
caresses or a desperate release of stress and frustration on one
who had capitulated?&#160; Yes, the exhibition was beginning to
deliver him into a new awareness and the two of them could sense
that it affected the other in the same way and also thrust that
individual into a soft sensitive regret for those who were never
given a chance to sense themselves against the tactile sensations
of the sun, the warmth, the feel of grass under bare feet, the
wind, the caresses, the rain, and the respite from inordinate heat
and sun.&#160; Feeling virile and assured of this new manhood
within him, he grabbed her hand swaying it in the pretense of joy
as they interweaved slowly around the myriad cabinets.&#160; He
stared at it all as fully as he could.&#160; It was there shelf
after shelf with some of it towering so high that he couldn&#8217;t
see it very well at all.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m so happy that you
aren&#8217;t afraid.&#160; When you come enough it almost seems
like there is a spirit hovering above it all and that they
appreciate someone being there for them.&#160; I know that is
silly.&#160; I&#8217;m not even religious.&#160; Maybe it is just
that it is very quiet.&#160; I often bring my books to the table
near the skeletons. I just do some reading. The doctors, the
nurses, and the museum curator don&#8217;t seem to mind.&#160; They
just say, &#8220;Hi, Piggy.&#8221;&#160; And again, it is a good
place to run away from it all.&#160; Maybe it is a bit of a strange
place to hide out for most people but most people are scared of
their own shadows.&#160; If nothing else this museum is a good
place to know what death is&#8212;or at least come as close as one
can. Most people haven&#8217;t a clue what really happens to
one&#8217;s body after death.&#160; Decaying corpses would of
course be better than this but they are vile to one&#8217;s nose
with everything going back to the elements and all.&#8221; They
descended the stairs.&#160; She sensed that his hand was very
sweaty.&#160; &#8220;You are glad that I brought you, aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Sure&#8221; he said although he
wasn&#8217;t fully.&#160; He knew that seeing this had made a dark
impression on him that he would never be able to shirk.&#160; He
suspected aptly that this friend of his had intentionally stabbed
the little innocence that was in him to match that of her
own.&#160; Enlightenment had punctured his innocence.&#160;
Outside, he stuffed his hands in his pockets.&#160; He felt a cold
numbness in his limbs, a slight coldness toward her, and ennui from
memories of his peculiar history that would impair his future
relationships with girls.&#160; They sat on the stoop.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t want to run
away from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#8220;I&#8217;m not running.&#160;
I&#8217;m sitting here with you, aren&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Okay, I guess so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;When you said &#8220;at least this was
not a lie,&#8221; what did you mean?&#160; I mean what are the
lies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;In society?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;There are too many to
count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Mention one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;All right&#8211;religion.&#160;
My parents are Christians. The servants are Christians.&#160; When
I was little the servants took me to Sunday school. There, the
teachers would always talk about heaven. I couldn&#8217;t figure
out why if one would be with her family in heaven after she dies,
as the church teaches, that wouldn&#8217;t mean being there with
all humanity regardless of religious preference.&#160; If one were
to be there with her father and mother, she&#8217;d be there with
hers, and she with hers, and she with hers, and that seems to me
like everyone. After all everybody is supposed to be related to
Adam.&#160; That to me would mean that heaven is some type of
polluted hellhole a million times worse than Bangkok with
overcrowding so that you can&#8217;t turn around without banging
into someone. I don&#8217;t know.&#160; It isn&#8217;t important
really.&#160; It just shows that nobody thinks anything out.&#160;
Maybe Heaven is just a Country Club only for Christian Hara
Krishnas who say Christ is salvation in rote but I can&#8217;t see
how they&#8217;d extend much of an invitation to me. I never have
been much into rote.&#8221; Jatupon didn&#8217;t know who the Hara
Krishnas were or what a Country Club was but these items
didn&#8217;t detract from his positive impression of her opposition
to sententious punctilio.&#160; He smiled.&#160; This was certainly
better than talking to a mosquito.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Tell me another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Another? All right.&#160; I can
keep firing them all day.&#160; I can&#8217;t see how they can
claim that King Phraya Taksin was really insane.&#160; I mean the
man created military strategies that were successful at getting the
Burmese out of the country, or at least removed to Changmai.&#160;
Then he decided to control the church as well as the
politics.&#160; He became arrogant and said that he was now equal
to Buddha and could dictate doctrine and political laws.&#160; The
people said that he was insane and his military executed him.&#160;
He didn&#8217;t just go from being a great military strategist to
insanity and if he was insane, that&#8217;s a sickness and they
wouldn&#8217;t have executed sick people&#8212;just people they
were scared of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;How do you know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s easy,
Jatupon.&#160; Just think it out.&#160; Use some intuition and
common sense.&#160; He just was overly ambitious and they hated him
and today we aren&#8217;t supposed to think of him at all except as
someone who was insane.&#160; We don&#8217;t even have a road with
his name attached to it. Have you ever traveled on Taksin
Road?&#160; It doesn&#8217;t exist. Back then they put the first
general in his place and declared him King Rama I.&#160; Kings
emerged from the Chakri Dynasty when really it should have been the
descendents of Taksin.&#160; I don&#8217;t even know why, in such a
poor country, we throw away tax money on these guys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Be quiet.&#160; Someone
might hear you.&#160; We could get arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Do you really think
they&#8217;d arrest 14 year olds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;They&#8217;d arrest
a 14 year old&#8217;s parents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;My father should be
arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Do you promise, as my best
friend, to not tell anyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;He raped
me.&#160; Don&#8217;t run away from me Jatupon.&#160; Promise you
won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No, of course I
won&#8217;t.&#8221; He felt nervous.&#160; He didn&#8217;t know
what to say.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;d never do anything like
that,&#8221; he affirmed.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;So, you will buy the
coffee?&#8221; she asked; and on the second floor of Black Canyon
the fumes of the molecules of coffee steam and &#8220;love&#8221;
slapped his senses. From the window of the air conditioned
restaurant they watched motor gondolas and express boats stir the
waters the way housewives in America would watch as their electric
blenders stir cake mixes&#8211;each wave falling, being sucked into
the force that pulled in the new part of the wave and then being
pushed out into the wave again.&#160; It was all so fast and all so
interconnected and systematic that each of the waves looked like
frozen motion or like society itself.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He became mesmerized in the weltering
waves.&#160; He spoke glibly. &#8220;Families are supposed to be
shelter.&#160; They&#8217;re really just walls cobbled up from
dirt, you know.&#160; Mine doesn&#8217;t even exist but in
Kazem&#8217;s head.&#160; I feel sorry for him in ways. But
sometimes I think I should just run away completely and become a
monk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Monks don&#8217;t have
sex.&#160; At least they aren&#8217;t supposed to.&#160; As you
said, lies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Do you have sex?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No, of course I&#8217;m a
little young for that,&#8221; he lied.&#160; He looked around the
restaurant to make sure that others were not listening to them.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to give up that part of me.&#160; I
don&#8217;t think that is right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;My Auntie --well, really
the servant but sort of the same except that she must obey me
usually&#8211;she says I should never come ten feet near a monk
since they are sexually repressed and might try to reach under a
girl&#8217;s skirt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Maybe but I&#8217;ve never
heard anyone talk that way about monks.&#160; The newspapers rarely
but that is with individual monks accused of crimes-- not monks
altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;My family is a bit
different that way. It&#8217;s their only good
attribute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; They sipped their coffee and then
went to Silom Road on the express boat. The annoyance of standing
there in a crowd without a seat became an ethereal essence of truth
and beauty for him. He could not remember being so happy. It stayed
with him as they road the bus to Lumpin Park.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At a lake, in the park, they rented out
a fishing boat.&#160; They paddled it chasing one puff of cloud in
the hope of using it as an umbrella.&#160; They had cheese
sandwiches, cola, sticky rice, and potato chips that they consumed
intermittently.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;If I stay much longer,&#8221;
she said an hour later, &#8220;they will start looking for
me&#8211;or at least the servants will.&#160; I usually only run
away on Saturdays and Sundays.&#160; I don&#8217;t like missing too
much school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He knew what he had suspected on
their first meeting: that her rebellion was far larger and more
personal than anything he had witnessed before.&#160; She kept
mostly to intangible subjects like religion because her repugnance
toward religion had been easier for her to communicate. He felt her
rebellion.&#160; It stood out like a Long Necked Karen (the native
Burmese people living in Changmai who had the tradition of
distorting the growth of their necks).&#160; He felt her rebellion
and it was a novelty for him.&#160; It intrigued him and it felt
wholly real.&#160; He thought, in Thailand one gave the
&#8220;wei&#8221; to Buddhist statues, stupas, shrines, temples,
and people who were older and of higher classes if such individuals
exerted a powerful role over him; and yet one did this not
understanding why it was done. It occurred to him that it was all
ludicrous in a way and not just limited to Thai customs.&#160; How
could she or anyone communicate the exact items that they were
rebelling from?&#160; Rebellion was seen in the eyes but it could
not be readily explained and in ways it went contrary to nature and
the social response. Greed and aggression were entrenched in the
survival of a being and lay latent but active within every cell but
those cells were sugar coated with that cloying substance of
Thailand, the land of smiles.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As they paddled back she looked up at
the puffy whiff of clouds above her and said, &#8220;This is
real.&#160; Relaxing and being part of the clouds and the second,
attaching to the mystery of it all . . . the universe and
time&#8211;that is the only thing that makes sense, don&#8217;t you
think?&#8221;&#160; He smiled and nodded his head in
pleasure.&#160; Yes, this was certainly better than talking to the
mosquito.&#160; How strange they were.&#160; Their serious probing
of life and their awareness of the geyser of unique thoughts that
erupted in them certainly didn&#8217;t seem Thai.&#160; A typical
urban Thai yearned to languish if not extinguish himself or herself
in strolls in a shopping mall, a movie, a video game, laughter,
cellular telephones, beer, and comic books.&#160; Jatupon did
pursue the pejorative in comic books as most Thai males from five
to fifty and the two of them were pursuing their quest of leisure
as lazily as the best of Thais; still to him they seemed so
different from all others.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; She asked about his parents and was
saddened to hear of their tragedy. She probed into it further in
interest and then backed away when she saw his pain.&#160; Kindness
and empathy emblazoned her countenance.&#160; She tried to mitigate
his pain by becoming absorbed in her own that she pursued
philosophically exempt of emotionalism. &#8220;My parents are
always moving around in the future. Ambition moves them around like
the places on a board game of chess&#8212;or draughts played by
motorcycle taxi drivers when they wait&#8212;with the pop bottle
caps&#8212;have you seen them?&#8221; He was startled by how her
ideas had such confluence with his own.&#160; She was an
augmentation of his own thoughts.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; They left the park reluctantly.&#160;
She did not want to leave at all without assurances and he offered
them.&#160; He told her that his brother was not a violent
person.&#160; He said that Kazem sometimes belted him when he
really deserved it but that there were plenty of times he deserved
it and yet his brother wouldn&#8217;t touch him.&#160; She seemed
to believe his assurances and went away.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As she vanished from his senses his
empty hollow mind was filled with images of half-headed beings,
twisted skeletons, rigid corpses like old ochre vases, the naked
man and the woman floating in their formaldehyde glass coffins with
their fronts carved out for the display of their entrails, the
fetuses and their placentas, one child that had such a gigantic
head and another one that had been born like a solid never feeling
motion. These images attacked his consciousness.&#160; It seemed to
him that the world was a loveless and ceaseless factory that
replicated over and over again manufacturing slightly damaged and
terribly damaged products with impunity.&#160; He paid his two baht
to the lady in the glassless window and went into the public
bathroom.&#160; He wept for those who had deserved better than
this.&#160; Then his weeping poured into himself.&#160; He knew
that after what he saw he should not want anything more from his
life than the noodles that sustained him and yet he did.&#160; He
knew he should not want a more purified love than what Kazem
extended to him and yet he nonetheless
did.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; The hours of that spring day came and went
indistinguishably from other seasons, and all days were clones with
stoic dispositions. His majesty, King Rama IX, a few hours earlier,
had changed the seasonable robes of the Emerald Buddha like a girl
dressing a doll.&#160; He then presided over the plowing ceremony
with its blessings to the rice goddess; and watched one cow predict
the agricultural future of the nation from its bovine
appetites--the cow wandering over to preferred troughs filled with
anything from brandy to barley, beans and rice, or just plain
water--instinctively consuming something or another interpreted as
conditions prosperous or economically disparaging.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Further into the heart of the city,
Suthep slept removed from the mooing of omniscient cows in Sanam
Luang which stood on an island of dirt where kites had flown
surrounded by inundating dark black exhaust fumes and fast,
obnoxious wheeled beasts, honking their loud voices as they passed
each other. Tucked in his smaller cell he rode the REM of
being.&#160; He dreamed he was on a motorcycle leaving his
uncomfortably tight partial apartment that was comfortably free of
brothers and awkward moments of catching them together.&#160; Hired
to cater his fried rice with chicken he cooked it, put it on paper
plates, and sealed the plates with plastic wrap. Then he put them
in baskets on opposite sides of a bamboo pole.&#160; Balancing the
pole of baskets on his back, he drove to a government
building.&#160; Why the banquet only had that one dish of
&#8220;kow pat&#8221; (fried rice) was a point that the dream did
not address.&#160; Also the street names were not those of the
Dusit area but those of central Bangkok. As he came near the
building , a limousine hit him and hurried off.&#160; Blood poured
from the orifice of his face. There was nothing but gray and a firm
belief he would die.&#160; The ambulance drivers, none of whom were
paramedics, came to pillage him of his wallet and watch. He got up,
Thai boxed them for his things, and realized as they ran from him
in fright that he was as ethereal as a cloud. And then his parents
came out of nothingness and he told them that they needed to go
away since he (ghost or man) was now a free agent and did not need
them any longer.&#160; As he got back on his motorcycle someone
knocked on the door.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He woke up but his brain was retarded
in an earlier being.&#160;&#160; As he heard the knocking he
imagined that Jatupon was lying beside him and listening to his
scurrying feet move toward the door.&#160; So many years they had
slept in the same room.&#160; They had slept side by side until a
few years ago.&#160; Did he love his brother so much that he would
wake up with him skirting around in his dreams?&#160; Maybe he did
since the habit of being with him was long.&#160; The youngest
sibling was so much of his past and he had been accustomed to him
without major aversion.&#160; The habit of being with someone
without major repugnance was indeed the only thing that constituted
fraternal love; and yet, little as it might be, it was what the
particles of black space in the universe were created for.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Suthep, slapped a cap on his head with
the visor inverted to the back of his head and greeted the knocker
in his underwear.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "A le nuh?," (what is it?), asked
Suthep as he straightened the cap. It was a man in livery asking
the surname of this family of impoverished brothers.&#160; Suthep
imagined the stink of his armpits as he addressed the guest and the
staleness of air in the room which was in deep need of a
deodorizer. He began to feel foolish but he kept his boyish poise
while the man tried to withhold his laughter.&#160; He didn&#8217;t
hear the question.&#160; The man repeated it and Suthep wanted to
prevaricate.&#160; Then he reluctantly said that his last name was
Biadklang.&#160; It was the senator&#8217;s page and they were
finally invited to meet the apotheosis that had given them their
living.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Chapter 11</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It was no wonder that one set of
freaks felt cognate with another set.&#160; For him, the sight of
the formaline or formaldyhyde-laden corpses at the Siriaj Hospital
Museum as well as the girl who introduced him to them seemed to
have exhilarated a nascent courage, an oozing, a growth hormone of
the mind.&#160; New neurological connections were burgeoning or the
same ones were reconnecting in different patterns. Anyhow, he felt
the inception of something new that made him feel that he
wasn&#8217;t quite the same: that he was outgrowing patterns of
behavior.&#160; He was not able to distinguish if his freakishness
was exceptional, deficient, or exceptionally deficient to the point
of being inept. Certainly if his gray matter made him innately
exceptional, his noodles made him less than ordinary. His gray
matter was becoming grayer with each dusk of a dying day.&#160;
Being with noodles so long no doubt loosened this compact tissue of
brain into something quite slimy. The use of his brain in the
mundane tasks of thinking about the size of meat he wanted to cut
with the butcher knife had perhaps cut his corpus callosum.&#160;
At least he thought so.&#160; But regardless of being superior or
inferior in his freakishness, this was who he was. There was a
history: the history was of being maimed.&#160; There was the
character of Jatupon: there were dark prodigious forces inside and
outside that frame that were ineluctable. No celestial power would
rectify his life by making family better than what it was or
himself, the sordid bastard that loomed there, as hallow and
saintly as what he once believed monks to be.&#160; Nature begot
freaks of the worst kind and so becoming a freak in the tossing of
the passing years was understandable.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jatupon&#8217;s ego was not
turgid.&#160; In ways it was self-deprecating. That which
hadn&#8217;t been squashed by his father and eldest brother, poured
into countless bowls, or slapped onto myriad plates had such
deformed and stunted growth. He had trouble making opinions about
people.&#160; He did it with shy reluctance and usually the
feelings he had about them never emerged all that much in a
cohesive thought. He considered Noppawan Piggy to be his superior
in intellect and yet there was one thing about her he had to admit
that he detested and that was the abhorrent smell of baby powder
that came from her body.&#160; It made Jatupon feel like his nose
had gotten trapped in a dust storm in which naked and screaming
babies flew with the dust in an attack against him. Not all girls
and women in Thailand smelled the same but those who had abhorrent
smells, although not abhorrent themselves, couldn&#8217;t be said
to be totally agreeable.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Upon leaving the park his intention was
to go to the library and look up information on the peculiarities
he had seen in the museum that had smiled upon him freak to freak
but he found himself distracted by a large comic book kiosk that
whisked him off from this world to that of another.&#160; One such
comic book was set into the future of 3000 AD and non-existent
creatures with little resemblance to anything extant propelled him
into problems of their non-existent agricultural and mining
planet-colonies and he lost himself there for an hour.&#160; How
splendid it was to lose oneself wholly and he savored the time
there until his left foot fell asleep while he was seated on a
plastic stool.&#160; Then he stood up.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Your time is up
again.&#8221;&#160; Jatupon faced a scrawny teenager with glasses
who was a year or two older than he was.&#160; &#8220;Are you
reading or buying?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Reading&#8221; he
said; but afterwards he stretched his neck only to see his
reflection in the store&#8217;s anti-theft mirror.&#160; The skin
around his eye looked darker and it felt even more painful.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You need
to pay another fifteen baht to continue reading.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No, I
guess I&#8217;ll stop reading.&#160; I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; he
said.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Standing there ready to go,
his taciturn heart pardoning Kazem who had been the only one who
cared about him, he tried to not think about the hot stinging of
the swelling around his eye.&#160; Instead, he thought about this
uncle whom he had only met on rare occasions long ago.&#160; It
seemed that it only took the frequent utterance of his name and
they had been granted a livelihood--a continuing sustenance as if
by magic.&#160; And yet it had not exactly been much of an effusion
of magic.&#160; It had been the most niggardly and scanty display
that any affluent magic man could bestow and it brought the renewal
of their servitude. Before they were restored to a similar but
diminished livelihood, they had often spoken of this vaguely real
or super-real entity (this uncle by a marriage) as one might think
of the early king Ramas of the Chakri Dynasty.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Walking away from the kiosk, he wanted
to return to early childhood: of hopscotch, climbing trees with his
brothers, Suthep teaching him how to throw a ball, taking cups of
ice to the customers so that they could pour out the water in
pitchers that were on their tables, skin around the eyes that
wasn&#8217;t black and swollen, and the time when his body
wasn&#8217;t being invaded.&#160; He could run away for good; but
where would he run?&#160;&#160; There was nothing in Ayutthaya and
if he really wanted to run away he would be more invisible in
Bangkok. He would need money.&#160; He considered becoming a Luk
Thung singer of Traditional Thai music.&#160; They wore their heavy
makeup and pointed golden tiaras for beggarly bits of baht.
However, he told himself that his voice probably wasn&#8217;t as
good as the worst of them and even if it was he did not want to do
tricks for a few baht.&#160; It was too demeaning and contrary to
the aristocratic life he envisioned. There was a famous Swedish Luk
Thung singer named Jonas Anderson who had lived his whole life in
Thailand but only someone with vocal training and boldness could
persevere to be someone accomplished in this musical
genre.&#160;&#160; He could run to Nappawan Piggy&#8217;s
home.&#160; He had the address on the mail she sent to him. But
there would be no sense in running to someplace that Noppawan
herself was running from and the likelihood of a rich family taking
in a strange teenager, and an ex-burglar and quasi-drug addict at
that, was more than a remote possibility.&#160; An emaciated dog
with clumps of fur falling out had a greater chance of being made
into a pet.&#160; Just as the need for the enzymes of animal
protein was one trait of many linking the human to and as an
animal, so enmeshed in soul, sentiment, and survival he clung to
Kazem for his sense of home and family.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He knew that he was just a collection
of molecules being shot out into space and time.&#160; Others were
the same but they flew away from him in their own deviant paths.
&#160;He knew.&#160; He thought he knew.&#160; Did he know?&#160;
Did he really know anything?&#160; Thoughts were so dreary.&#160;
They enervated him. He got on a bus to go home (that stationary
foundation from which outlook, experience, thought, and restoration
of energy for movement were generated). Even on such a simple event
as going home he was lost in the intricate circuits of his brain,
lost in the labyrinth within himself.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; But
through the window he saw the clear beauty of other beings that
passed; and even in the ugly faces there was a posture, a smile,
even a vehement depth of lonely despair so uniquely beautiful and
yet universal.&#160; The bus passed four stores each of which
seemed to alternate a presentation of boys, dogs, and combinations
sleeping against the facades of buildings. The passing was quick
like fingers moving against a keyboard and the sight was as
euphonious as melancholy in sound.&#160; Then for a second, in
stalled traffic, Jatupon found himself looking into the deep eyes
of a deformed boy beggar. Jatupon was inside the bus and the boy
outside of it, but they both saw an affinity in each other.&#160;
They were the same.&#160; They were both unfortunate beggarly
outsiders beaten up by life; and yet he was riding around in an
air-conditioned bus.&#160; He was not one of the 2 billion people
who lived on 2 dollars a day in a rural area on the verge of
starvation.&#160; Inside the bus the facial expressions of the
money collector were stone as death with monotony that was
distinct, ebullient, and luminous as sunlight against wind-rippled
leaves. A woman sleeping in a seat to his right had a head that
fell toward the aisle, straightened, fell again, and straightened
like a pendulum.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He might have gone back to work to
appease Kazem.&#160; He might have started taking orders from the
customers with no explanation and let the hours make the whole
issue of his long absence mute.&#160; His brother would not have
made an embarrassing scene in public.&#160; The hours would alone
have just slowly uncorked it all allowing the rage to disperse
slowly and unnoticed.&#160; The restoration of old habits would
have made the past issue so irrelevant that a bit of the mind would
have questioned if his absence had even occurred.&#160; It had been
his intention to do so when he left the comic book kiosk and it
continued to be his intention when he sat on the seat in the
bus.&#160; Yet a human being fulfilled few intentions.&#160;
Scholars were sociable creatures who needed meaningless action and
cacophony even when it adulterated their aims. Petty government
officers on their meager salaries, as well as the well-paid top
tier, didn&#8217;t need to be cloistered in the political issues
that mired the day but yearned for sports columns in their
newspapers and genuflected to the action effusing from their
television sets. And tired people on Bangkok busses that were
plodding their way slowly through traffic had intentions other than
sleep but yearned for rest and an easy way home.&#160; He was one
of the latter that needed sleep; and yet when he was in the cell,
which was his home, his mind was active in dread.&#160; Its color
was gray, its texture coarse, and the molecules that oozed up from
it acrid.&#160; Within the space of his own head he was vanquished
in the gloom, the nothingness, the vanished thoughts of the hollow
cavities that were part of one waiting for punishment.&#160; He lay
on the floor with an old, previously read comic book in his
hands.&#160; His head was so preoccupied with the barrenness of
thought and the feeling of dread that he didn&#8217;t understand
the pictures and the words.&#160; He got up.&#160; He dipped up a
bowl of rice from a rice cooker, drenched it in soy, chili sauce,
and a bit of pepper and vinegar. He did his pushups in front of a
televised soccer game and when the game was over he shut off the
set and in an hour sleep percolated over him.&#160; In his dreams
he was in a penthouse on the fifteenth floor and below him were
beggars like moving dots.&#160; Above the moving dots were moving
golden skies of sunset.&#160; Gigantic clouds moved through the air
in the shape of viruses.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Then there was a punch on his face and
it reopened the facial wound causing blood to rush on the
floor.&#160; In that second his dream fragmented into many dreams
and spun out of control.&#160; He was no longer in a penthouse but
was a sidewalk-based seamster with his little antique sewing
machine, a petal, and a hill of torn clothes he was supposed to
sew.&#160; He was all alone on a cement cover of a city sewer that
went under the sidewalk. Then he fell into the sewer.&#160; Self
was gone. In the last of his dream or dreams, before he completely
awakened, there was no self.&#160; There was just the scene of a
large park ahead of him, the aesthetic glow of a withdrawing sun,
and an old man who bought some phad-thai and found a pavilion near
a lake.&#160; He sat down and began to eat his noodles, watching
the lights of skyscrapers and the fast moving traffic far beyond
the lake.&#160; The cacophony of boys playing football irritated
him because he was envious of it.&#160; He put his empty Styrofoam
container back in the plastic bag and laid it down.&#160; A rat
scurried from one flower and fern bed; and dragged the bag into
another flowerbed.&#160; The old man could hear the gnawing of the
Styrofoam.&#160; Jatupon sensed that the rat might be himself.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He felt blood oozing from him and
uniting as a puddle under his face.&#160; Kazem, dumbfounded by the
vehement rage that disgorged from him, floundered a few steps in
the room, sat down, and whined, &#8220;It&#8217;s all on me. If you
are on drugs or stealing something, I&#8217;ve got to get you out
of it.&#160; It&#8217;s all on me. I have to be responsible for you
but you just do whatever you please.&#8221;&#160; His voice trailed
away and faltered.&#160; He cleared his throat. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t ever behave with any responsibility toward me. I give
you days off here and there.&#160; I don&#8217;t get any.&#160; You
work or don&#8217;t work or work for one of us and not the other
based on how you feel on a given day.&#160; You steal money out of
my pockets and I don&#8217;t say anything. Don&#8217;t blame me.
You&#8217;ve brought it on yourself.&#8221;&#160; Jatupon sat up
and glared with one eye.&#160; The second eyelid was already
drooping from swelling.&#160; It wouldn&#8217;t open fully and it
squinted from a bit of blood that sank into it.&#160; He
intuitively guessed that his brother knew he was losing control of
him.&#160; He waited and observed the guilt-ridden countenance and
the gauche retreat from the offensive.&#160; He judged that the
assault had been a desperate one.&#160; Jatupon smiled malevolently
as of a masochist exuding pride that the pain had only brought the
opposite wish of the inflictor.&#160; Kazem&#8217;s unpaid noodle
worker who wasn&#8217;t allowed to loosen his fetters and shackles
had slipped from them anyway.&#160; He had gone out to see Piggy
and there was nothing Kazem had been able to do to stop him.&#160;
Jatupon smiled wider.&#160; Then he guffawed scoffingly like a
lunatic although the pleasure soon extinguished itself.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Do you want me to come over there and
squeeze the juice out of your head?&#8221;&#160; The muscles in
Kazem&#8217;s arms and legs suddenly stiffened like one ready to
suddenly stand and attack.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m not listening to you,&#8221;
Jatupon spoke firmly. &#8220;You are a pathetic bully&#8212;a
fucking ape--and it is the end of it for me.&#160; It is the end of
it!&#8221; Manhood&#8217;s conviction and effrontery reeked from
his mouth like foul breath and Kazem, who already wanted to wreak
havoc on his impudence, flipped him over with the elastic of his
underwear like a pancake.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Okay, swim in your own blood.
Swim! Let&#8217;s see you drown in it.&#8221;&#160; Jatupon&#8217;s
hair was twisted in Kazem&#8217;s fingers and his face was in his
own blood as the thick leather hand swatted him a few lateral
slaps.&#160; Then Kazem&#8217;s compunction again caused him to
flounder back to his seat.&#160; It was the only chair in the
room.&#160; He put his elbow on his leg and hand on the forehead of
his genuflected head.&#160; His ideas were
discombobulated.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160; Jatupon was floundering too from more than the
nausea of lost blood.&#160; He was half a boy and half a man and
this newly begotten half called a &#8220;man&#8221; was having
manhood castigated, excoriated, and leaked from him.&#160; Callow
as he was, he was not just half a man or half a boy the way the
Nightjar poem concerned itself with a bird-boy. He was a hybrid of
boy/man and God with vast wisdom from fathoms of himself examined
from suffering.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He again stared at the other presence
in the room.&#160; It was a monster, a being of violence, and an
unknown phantom. Still this monster was the one who had delivered
him from the watery abyss, the one who did not chastise his
addiction (at least then he didn&#8217;t) but was with him through
the withdraws, the one who fixed his bicycle, who had introduced
him to basketball and his first beer. Appearing like his brother it
was the brother mixed with some type of shadowy creature he could
not comprehend and this being, familiar and unfamiliar, he
loathed.&#160; The elastic of his underwear had been
encroached.&#160; He had been violated with those fingers. His body
had been flipped over like a pancake.&#160; He had felt his face
pushed in a puddle of his blood.&#160; Sitting on the floor,
piercing him with his eyes, he wanted to purge this beast from his
life.&#160; Then a few seconds later his next conscious assembly of
understanding only made him want to vanish.&#160; He wanted so much
of the impossible that second: for the substance of his own life to
vaporize swiftly and meaninglessly and opposite of this, to kill
the monster and resurrect his dwarfed manhood in his own eyes.
Sitting there he felt as if time had ended and that all entities on
the Earth were waiting and watching the two of them in silent dread
but neither god nor man cared about any aspect of this relationship
at all.&#160; Things went on as cruel as death.&#160; In one second
a fly flew and landed in a bottle of water, a dog barked from
outside, a rat scurried around in front of the building for food, a
family was feuding in the apartment above him, and a car came onto
the thin long back-road called a soi.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Kazem looked onto this bludgeoned ugly
little face reluctantly and Jatupon felt like a piggish or bovine
woman whose acquaintance said, &#8220;We could never be more than
friends, you know&#8221; and she--Yes, she could see. She could
see--hadn't she seen it before?&#160; Had she really dismissed
those countless earlier smirks of repugnance aimed at her fat
enervated face and her clumsy tense body both of which made her
nothing.&#160; Mother nature made the being breed with the best of
bodies to create a good physical specimen in the baby.&#160; Sex,
romance, or just an intimate talk with a man would not be hers
since she could not trigger the pleasure response--not even
intellectually.&#160; Romantic and sexual inclinations were
discriminatory.&#160; They were as cruel as death and she would
tell him that sex wasn't intimacy although she wouldn&#8217;t
believe it.&#160; She craved such intimacy more than she could ever
articulate and she would not tell him that. She would tell him that
being in love was a delusion that one biologically craved to
propagate the species. She would say that she did not want to go
through the brief illusion of being in love.&#160; She did not want
to be high in urinary molecules from his underwear flying into her
face when he had her denuded and lying on a bed littered in
clothes. She would tell him that one generation after another would
dance its sexual dance before passing and that she had been
fortunate enough to be born a disagreeably unaesthetic thing with a
face like a mushy old apple.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Feeling sick and weak, his mind was
running away from him.&#160; His head was thinking himself a
different gender. He was believing that he could hear the content
of the feuding family upstairs.&#160; The eldest son, having gotten
his girlfriend pregnant, had been compelled to bring her into the
home and the fight was about him running away from the family every
evening after work to drink with his buddies.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Then suddenly, without even
knowing it, he stood up, grabbed the television that Kazem had
given to him as a gift, and he was running toward him.&#160; There
he was aiming the television at his brother&#8217;s head only to
have it reflexively snatched from him by Kazem&#8217;s dexterous
fingertips.&#160; Finally, there he was peering up at it and
backing away into the corner where he came from, realizing that one
impulse materialized in action had caused a counter action that was
about ready to kill him.&#160; It had been just one unrestrained
impulse that, repulsive to the consciousness, he hadn&#8217;t even
considered; and it had slipped from his brain slimy as a
worm.&#160; It had materialized in action and now it had lethal
consequences.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Don&#8217;t play so hard,
boys&#8221; said Kumpee.&#160; In Jatupon&#8217;s perspective the
stink of his smoke-ridden clothes and the beer of his breath gave
an acrid and fetid cloud which was miraculously saving him.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Kazem lowered his arms.&#160;
&#8220;Where the hell have you been?&#8221; he asked. He put the
television on the floor relieved at having escaped the worst
passion that can fulminate in a man and lose him in the deepest
abyss of regret.&#160; Sweat poured from Kazem&#8217;s forehead and
his face became a deep red in chagrin.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;With my woman. If you were to
have a woman you wouldn&#8217;t have so much time to play with your
Jatu-PORN.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Where&#8217;s our
money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Invested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Invested how?&#8221;&#160; He
grabbed the chair and sat down.&#160; He wiped the sweat from his
forehead.&#160; Jatupon was already seated in a corner with his
puddle of blood.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;But your worries have
ended.&#160; The senator&#8217;s page visited you, didn&#8217;t
he?&#160; Maybe he was our uncle&#8217;s chauffeur.&#160; I forget
now.&#160; You look confused.&#160; He came to my apartment to tell
me the definite date for the agreed dinner after somehow finding
Suthep and informing him.&#160; Well, anyhow, it happened because
of my own efforts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You visited him and got him to agree
to see us?&#160; You? How could you do that looking as you do? I
tried many times.&#160; I don&#8217;t believe you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s nothing I
can do about your hateful beliefs, but all the same I&#8217;m
telling you the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;So, you are the big brother
looking after all of us now&#8221; said Kazem incredulously. He
snickered.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Sure. It&#8217;s obvious by age
and merit.&#160; I&#8217;ve never tried to kill one of you in the
entire duration of my 18 years.&#160; Aren&#8217;t I the lucky
omen?&#160; I saved you both from killing each other and had some
additional favorable news to spill out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;What was your reason for coming
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Nothing.&#160; Just to make sure
you were coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;When?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Next Saturday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;6 p.m.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You can deal with him.&#160; I
don&#8217;t want to stay here tonight.&#160; I&#8217;m finished
watching over these two.&#160; I&#8217;m leaving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Two?&#160; I only see one.&#160;
The other monkey didn&#8217;t like you and ran away.&#160; And
where, might I ask, are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;A Hotel.&#160; A bar.&#160; A
massage parlor.&#160; Anywhere I like although it isn&#8217;t any
of your business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;It seems rather wasteful to me
when I have provided this apartment for you rent-free but I guess
you can go ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Kazem laughed sardonically for a
minute.&#160; He needed to release the shock of discovering the
vile hatred that had arisen in himself and Jatupon and the
serendipitous arrival of Kumpee, who if worthless at everything
else, had delivered them from being sealed into the body bags of
unrestrained emotion.&#160; &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been rent free
for a long time. We get billed from the father of your Chinese
bitch and we pay the money like responsible tenants&#8212;bank
transfers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;She was a bitch,&#8221; said
Kumpee pensively.&#160; He became preoccupied with this
self-absorbed thought. &#8220;And her father just couldn&#8217;t
warm up to what could have been his son in law.&#160; I&#8217;m
seeing her sister now.&#8221;&#160; Then he stared at Kazem with a
specific intent.&#160; &#8220;Just remember the appointment and
that you need to be punctual.&#160;&#160; Since you need some time
away I&#8217;ll look after the little one.&#8221;&#160; Jatupon
mumbled a response.&#160; &#8220;What did you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No, come on.&#160; What did you
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t need you.&#160; I
hate you worse than I hate him,&#8221; said Jatupon.&#160; Kumpee
laughed and then all of them were taciturn for a minute. Kazem
folded some clothes and put them in a bag.&#160;&#160; Kumpee got a
bottle of coca cola from a carton in the corner and pulled off the
bottle top by wedging it like a lever between the drawer of a
cabinet and its handle.&#160; He drank slowly savoring every
sip.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Maybe that attitude toward older
brothers is what has caused your head to be kicked around like a
football,&#8221; said&#160; Kumpee after Kazem left the apartment
and he heard the door shut.&#160; &#8220;What do you think about
that, you little monkey,&#8221; he said as his fingers disheveled
Jatupon&#8217;s hair abrasively and then pulled his ear
playfully.&#160; &#8220;Just you and me, Jatuporn.&#160;
Jatuporn.&#160; Why do you think that you are called
Jatuporn?&#8221;&#160; Jatupon slithered into a dry corner and
began to shake.&#160; He tried not to cry.&#160; &#8220;Why did you
do that?&#160; I&#8217;m not going to hurt you,&#8221; said Kumpee;
but it was really the loss of blood, the trauma, the opaque
surrealism of what had occurred that made him tremble.&#160;
&#8220;I see your eyes all watered.&#160; You want to cry,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I want to sleep.&#160; I
don&#8217;t understand any of this.&#160; I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to know more
than I do about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Well I don&#8217;t&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Mmmm.&#160;&#160; Well, he was
ready to put you in the television.&#160; You did something you
shouldn&#8217;t or maybe you just wouldn&#8217;t let him put
himself into you.&#160; Have you become a frigid bitch?&#160; Have
you, Jatuporn?&#160; You thought I didn&#8217;t know about that,
didn&#8217;t you?&#160; You thought that the nickname we created
for you didn&#8217;t mean anything but just meanness but we had a
reason for giving it to you.&#8221;&#160; He chuckled.&#160;
&#8220;I keep an eye on my boys.&#160; That you can be sure
of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Kumpee sat down beside the sprawled
body of his brother and drank his cola in equanimity, from time to
time placing the bottle between his legs.&#160; &#8220;I needed
more from my life than this, you know.&#160; Do you remember when
we were kids and we collected bottles like this. &#160;We got a few
baht from the stores for every twenty we brought into them.&#160;
We thought we would buy a Chinese restaurant for father and mother
with air conditioning and an electric juke box.&#8221;&#160; He
laughed.&#160; &#8220;Maybe you don&#8217;t remember.&#160; You
were four or five.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I do.&#8221; Jatupon really
couldn&#8217;t remember this but yearning for some unadulterated
version of innocent love or compassion not linked to the selfish
inclinations that were part of being human, he halfway believed
that he remembered and he put his hand on his brother&#8217;s
arm.&#160; Kumpee&#8217;s posture tightened.&#160; The eldest
brother felt squeamish from a man&#8217;s hand on him but, not
wanting to reject the youngest outright he did not move his
arm.&#160; Also, a sick curious depravity began to flood out of the
squalor of the recesses to his mind.&#160; He looked at the
half-empty phallic bottle, picked it up, and said &#8220;What about
this bottle?&#160; Would you take in anything hard?&#8221; But the
youngest brother was asleep and so, a minute later, he removed the
hand and abandoned him.</p>

Chapter 12</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It was their third time playing the
board game of Monopoly that week and Porn sensed that another
ineluctable habit was being imposed onto her more from within than
without.&#160; She often deliberately tossed the dice directly into
his token when it was near her side of the board but mostly her
rolling was with a lethargic rattling in her palm and the apathetic
dropping of dice from her numb fingertips. Once she spilled the
content of her glass, which then flooded over Marlborough and Vine
Streets as well as Community Chest. She snowed her popcorn crumbs
over two colors of property. He silently blamed her clumsiness on
the vodka that she had mixed into her cola.&#160;&#160; From time
to time he could see irascible facial expressions cutting through
her guile of complacent concentration and close lipped smiles but
he told himself it was just a bit of competitive strife or
tipsiness even though he knew better. At the beginning of each
game, for the brief period that it lasted, he felt for certain that
she enjoyed playing and discussing life with him.&#160; He was
right about the former.&#160; For her the beginning of the game
brought the rush of accumulating play-money, gibbering her attempts
at English to play the game, and having one monotony replace that
of another.&#160; The game was one way of killing an hour or more
of a given day as sedately as a hot bath.&#160; She hated cold
weather to such extremes that, outside of her irregular attendance
at the language school, the nearby grocery store a block or two
away from this distant campus had become her only cultural
attraction.&#160; She was waiting for spring but meanwhile her life
was becoming as frigid as a housewife.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220; It certainly is coming
down,&#8221; he said as he heard hail beat against the windows.
&#8220;You surely aren&#8217;t thinking about going out in
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I never do,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I mean you can if you
want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes, master.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You get to massage
my feet for that comment, dearest.&#160; I especially like it when
you go down on each toe the way you do; but, as a gentleman, I
don&#8217;t force that on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No, master.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Do you like anything about
the classes at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;The students and the
teacher are old, Nawin. There&#8217;s nothing to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;How old?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Old.&#160; Retirement age.
&#8220;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Hmm&#8230; it is strange
that they should be immigrating to Canada at an old age like
that.&#8221;&#160; She ignored him.&#160; &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know Nawin.&#160;
Roll your dice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; She knew that the only force really
binding her on that chair at the kitchen table was herself. She was
uncomfortable with his tenderness because it shackled her at his
side but out of courtesy to him she tolerated the situation with
only a few major grimaces. This quality time together had occurred
for her sake but she minimized its effects where she could.&#160;
She cynically told herself that these games were his pathetic way
of finding relief from his solitary ways. She felt sorry for him
and this sympathy ameliorated the loathing she was beginning to
feel for the introverted bore.&#160; Looking back on what she knew
of him, she assessed that this wooer of whores had always stayed in
safe circles.&#160; In Thai parties that they had attended
following his exhibits he had never been much of a mingler
and&#160; had relied on her to be his public relations
gadabout.&#160;&#160; Here in Canada he wasn&#8217;t a
celebrity.&#160; For him there were just classes and an occasional
sale of a painting.&#160; She had no role with him here.&#160; She
was a bed partner and a grocery shopper.&#160; Even when fulfilling
the wifely forgery of grocery shopping, she was curtailed by
financial considerations.&#160; If she didn&#8217;t buy generic
food of inferior taste he reprimanded her for overspending.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Porn asked if Park Place and Boardwalk
were real properties and he told her that they might be.&#160; It
was a question that she had also posed two days earlier but Nawin
responded to it with the same cheerfulness as if there had been
sense in asking it a second time. She asked if he thought they were
well known New York City properties and he told her that was quite
possible.&#160; She glanced at their quality time together through
the slow perennial movements of the second hand. These movements of
the long second hand were so wobbly as if 60 seconds were like
climbing over a mountain range. She would not only glance up at the
kitchen clock but also the window as if expecting the snow to be
melted and birds singing in her window.&#160; She had wanted his
attention and now that she had it she realized that this was just
aspirin dulling the headache.&#160; There was a bigger
problem.&#160; Being poor and lacking choices had caused her rabid
craving for more of everything just as something long ago down deep
in him was probably responsible for his artistic brooding.&#160;
The past was always sucking one into its whirlpool.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He rolled the dice and moved his
token.&#160; &#8220;Oh, Old Kent Road&#8212;I want that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why do you want worthless
properties like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t think either of
those two properties are worthless.&#8221;&#160; He smiled as
radiantly as a child pleased to have one of his best friends
participating in one of his favorite games. He closed his lips in a
tight thoughtful smile.&#160; &#8220;You know what I&#8217;ve been
thinking about?&#8221;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No.&#8221; She
didn&#8217;t really care.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;When you met Piggy for the first
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; She frowned.&#160; Was this what they
had become: a couple of tycoon wannabes, two individuals acting
like a married couple, or worse two people acting like an old
couple reminiscing about their early days in front of bored games
or a deck of cards?&#160; They did not have years
together&#8212;just two or three months of knowing each other--and
she thought he had no right to reminisce about anything.&#160; As
much as she hated the past, the present was equally bad at
absorbing one in its reality. She had now become his wife because
she was with him at present. His wife had been relegated as one
force that had brought them together because she was not
immediately accessible nor was she sexual. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she
said disinterestedly. She rolled the dice with more force and moved
her token from the present to the future. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take
that railroad,&#8221; she said.&#160; Still she couldn&#8217;t help
being influenced by him and for a couple seconds she was absorbed
in that immediate past.&#160; That day had been good but strange.
After Noppawan had taken her shopping at Chatuchok Market for
clothing, they briefly went into the Butterfly Farm and Insect
Museum (a neutral alternative to the deleterious proposal of Siriaj
Hospital&#8217;s dead people museum that made Porn gasp).&#160; The
butterflies were fine.&#160; She enjoyed seeing their colors
flittering around the caged park although the encasement of dead
insects in the adjacent room was not to her liking.&#160; The face
bug with its human camouflage on its back was for her as
frightening as it was fascinating to Noppawan.&#160; She watched
this wife of Nawin.&#160; She was the type that would put her nose
and glasses up against, in her opinion, the damnedest of things.
When they arrived at the married couple&#8217;s second home on the
opposite part of the city he was fixing a meal for the three of
them.&#160; He was preparing salad, toasting hamburger buns on a
barbeque, and microwaving meatless tofu hamburgers in a culture
that was all his own.&#160; As the two women chatted on the balcony
Porn tried to overcome feeling like a face bug caught in a key
chain. As they ate, dusk elongated and then intertwined their
shadows before night approached. Soon the remnant of the day became
a violet, a purple, and a black and she felt like a child first
introduced to colors through crayons.&#160; They watched the lit
barges on the river and gorgeous glassy skyscrapers with lit
angular tiaras.&#160; Strangely enough she felt at peace with them
as if they were more than friends but family and the words of model
or prostitute did not exist. Still it was strange and uncomfortable
because it was so strange.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He dreamed that he was in her mind,
that there was adrenalin in the rebellion, that this adrenalin was
the meaning of it all, and that the meaning of all emblazoned from
her.&#160; Immediate relatives and some more distant ones had her
life planned for her; and her parents, the main instigators of the
status quo in their family, were rocks.&#160; They didn&#8217;t
change apart from greed that intensified with years and
tiers.&#160; Stratums of higher and more violent winds raged them
in insatiable appetites.&#160; Wants fed more wants
insatiably.&#160; They stayed on the same growing pieces of land,
had the same opulent homes and efficient factories (although more
and more of them), matched political ideas to whatever brought
benefits to their wallets, and with these government positions they
implanted such aspirations on the little brother&#8217;s mind with
the idea that he was clay by which a conqueror with a double edged
sword of business and politics was formed. After going into the
monastery to have his foray as a monk and finishing his university
education he would be this and once she found a man in college she
would be that.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; She, the girl, would be less of the
plan but still, years into the future, they would partition a piece
of their land and give it to her husband.&#160; She would be
expected to reproduce her higher beings on their land allowing the
elderly parents to be spared of loneliness by the sounds of young
voices.&#160; She would be expected to take care of them as their
servants had taken care of her and to absolutely inebriate them of
any suffering as if Buddha&#8217;s attempts at bypassing human
suffering had been an avoidance of it. This would begin in a decade
or so (such a quick passing of time).&#160; She would be expected
to succumb to female yearnings&#8212;this needing of another to
escape the lonely void, this need to reach out for the silk of
human flesh, to consume, to care, to be intermingled entities in
love, and reproduce.&#160; And yet she had been nothing but a
little doll that they had shown off and shoved into a storage room
especially when she was dirty or naughty.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And then her bedroom became a limb of a
tree and there she was transforming into an adult female mosquito
and he was becoming a male one.&#160; There they both were in
complete maturity.&#160; He did his dance and he rubbed his legs so
as to attract her with his sound.&#160; She was ceramic in her
stiffness.&#160; Her skin was ochre like the dead bodies at the
Siriaj Hospital museum sunk into their glass caskets of
formaldehyde. &#160;Yet her eyes were lively even though they
looked at him so askance and distant.&#160; She smiled with her
closed insect lips.&#160; The smile was ingenuous and warm but
wry.&#160; He could tell from these infinitesimal muscular
contractions and relaxation in her stony insect face that she did
not want him to think of their friendship as a relationship and the
words passed from brain to brain (hers to his, his to hers, and
hers to his like a mutating ping pong ball) something to the effect
that a being was born selfish and two selfish beings together were
a compounded selfish knot and so something new was in order.&#160;
Something new was in fact in order.&#160; There, ardent in her
eyes, was the relationship of her parents: it was based on hording
property and power.&#160; It also was based on begetting emotional
servants for their old age and that in particular abhorred
her.&#160; But he, the male mosquito that was programmed for
copulation and no other task, loved her.&#160; He had to since he
needed her for the satisfaction of his hungers and a deliverance
from the past.&#160; He continued with his male-on-the make
dance.&#160; She bit into him.&#160; His blood was on her lips.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And when he woke up he wasn&#8217;t
himself.&#160; His ideas were discombobulated and he could tell
that his consciousness or sanity was like a loose button on a thin
thread dangling from his shirt.&#160; He was ill and numb as if all
of his senses were bandaged over in gauze.&#160; He woke up fully,
checked his face in the mirror to see that it was still the same,
and washed it.&#160; He tried to desist from many thoughts.&#160;
Thoughts were pins stabbing him. He turned on the television, muted
the sound, and saw images as the hours of the day became
vanquished.&#160; Then Kazem came back early to bring him some food
and in so doing he suspended their mutual reticence briefly.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I have some food for you,&#8221;
he said in disgust.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Thanks&#8221; Jatupon responded
in insolent despondency.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The next day it was the same.&#160;
Kazem came back briefly with some food and a new pair of sunglasses
for Jatupon&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I have some food for you,&#8221;
he said in disgust.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Thanks&#8221; Jatupon responded
in insolent despondency.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I also have some sunglasses for
you&#8221; Kazem said in disgust.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Thanks&#8221; Jatupon responded
with a surly and begrudging tone of a nearly mute volume.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He controlled his contempt out of an
instinct for self- preservation.&#160; He wanted to keep himself
from being bludgeoned with the sledgehammer of his brother&#8217;s
fist or beaten with the leather skin of his slaps.&#160; Kazem
wanted to ask if Kumpee had said anything more about their dinner
engagement with the senator as an effort to establish its
veracity&#8212;a senator they called uncle as a disingenuous ploy
to bring them into a greater stratum of wanting and needing, winds
of higher and more pleasurable velocity.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The mosquito buzzed around Jatupon's
blackened eyes and then around the opened bottle of glue.&#160;
With his wings he made a pejorative click the way people use their
tongues when they shake their heads. Jatupon was not glad to see
him. He did not want the condemnation. At first this glue-begotten
ride had been an enjoyable thrill.&#160; The newness of a newborn
was at that time gleaming out of his orbs.&#160; He was like a
child in wonder of himself flossing his toes in the grass, having
his hair massaged by the winds, and chasing god in the
clouds.&#160; Now the mosquito was here spoiling the solitary party
of one which was steadily waning.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The mosquito greeted him in
English. &#8220;Hello, little man.&#8221; He thought it was Kumpee
at first but, to his knowledge, Kumpee didn&#8217;t know any
language apart from the strident sounds of Thai and was more in
favor of using the word &#8220;monkey&#8221; in place of
&#8220;little man.&#8221;&#160; Jatupon looked down at a gigantic
insect that was nonetheless smaller than himself.&#160; He
responded in the same international tongue with a hello.
&#8220;Where did you learn your English?&#8221; asked Jatupon; but
no sooner had he done this than he realized how foolish the
question was since the mosquito was an extension of himself.&#160;
For some reason he was both cognizant of the fact that the creature
didn&#8217;t exist and yet believing in him.&#160; It was
undeniable that if Buddha was right in claiming that the self was a
delusion there was a chance that instead of the mosquito being less
real it might be more real than himself.&#160; It was true that the
mosquito wasn&#8217;t afraid of a man but a man was afraid of a
mosquito.&#160; Wasn&#8217;t that, he asked himself, proof that the
one who wasn&#8217;t afraid was more real?</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Where did you learn your
English? &#8221;asked the mosquito.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Music, TV shows, story books
from the library, Newsweek in my more ambitious times, cartoons
mostly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Well, then, me too&#8221; the
mosquito said. It paused and then pulled out a cigarette from its
gums and lit it without a match by striking it against the metallic
hair on one of its legs. &#8220;Another day without going to
work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Another day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Taking it a bit easy?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Taking it a bit easy.&#160;
Yes,&#8221; answered Jatupon.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I would like to know why you
have a black eye and a swollen face."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "You know everything and yet I&#8217;m
supposed to believe that it hasn&#8217;t it occurred to you that
I&#8217;m not wanting to think about this&#8211;about this
situation I&#8217;m in."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I understand that but am nonetheless
curious what you have to say on the subject."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Very little, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;"All right.&#160; Are you snorting glue
because of what has happened to you?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Why ask so many questions?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Because I am cruel."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Yes, you are, you know."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "You don't like me at all?"</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Oh," Jatupon sighed, "I do like you in
ways."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "What a charming endorsement! I elicit
the same response everywhere I go.&#160; Oh well...truth doesn't
have to be a comfortable realm.&#160; It rarely is."</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Yes," said Jatupon pensively, "I
imagine it rarely is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;The pain is so overwhelming you
can&#8217;t work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;The boredom is so overwhelming I
can&#8217;t work.&#160; It is a rot&#8211;a rot under my
hairnet.&#160; I can&#8217;t do it&#8211;reflexes every day and not
with&#8211;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The mosquito waited to hear the
word &#8220;him.&#8221;&#160; &#8220;Go ahead and say it&#8221; was
in the mosquito&#8217;s thoughts but it was Jatupon who articulated
this oblique command, &#8220;Go ahead and say it!&#8221; to twist
the direction of the conversation .</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221;
said the mosquito.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you wanting to give
me your lecture that I have to survive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t going to say
anything but you are meant for more than this dizzying work and the
instinct to survive is thrust on all living things in all actions.
You can&#8217;t but help obey it to some degree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I can&#8217;t do it any
longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You might have a nervous
breakdown if you were to continue.&#160; Kazem was your link.
It&#8217;s gone now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;d rather die than go
back to it now.&#160; Die in the streets if I have to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I think you are zipping up your
pants again and finding them too tight.&#160; You are shedding your
boyhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Do you really think
so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the mosquito
pensively.&#160; &#8220;Unfortunately, it was your best
trait.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The mosquito dissipated with the smoke
of Jatupon&#8217;s cigarette that he rested and twirled in his
fingertips.&#160; Smoking was his new habit that he pursued in the
hope of having a more insouciant image, which with practice, he
could learn to believe in. Boys of himself at earlier ages came and
pressed their noses near him as he had done long ago to the glass
outside the Dunkin Doughnuts Restaurant in Ayuttayha.&#160;&#160;
Long lost versions of himself at various ages passed up against him
and passed him by.&#160; They too dispersed with the gaseous midst
of black carbon smog released by the traffic.&#160; His head was
spinning around skyscrapers and billboards.&#160; They, he, a
single homeless woman who rented out babies to increase the chances
of getting more substantial alms, two dogs copulating, and all,
were dwarfed in advertisements for shark fins for the man with
refined taste, Electric piecemeal billboards for Singh Beer and
cellular telephone companies with new images rotating with the
pieces, plain billboards of pimpleless white skinned Thai models
selling or hustling some facial cream, flashing and mutating signs
advertising various self-improvements seminars at different
universities and at the Convention Center,&#160; neon animations of
Barcelona&#8217;s Bangkok tour for the Invitation Cup Football
Match,&#160; and advertisements for every international and
domestic product imaginable thrust into the hands of consumers in
the form of flyers.&#160; Indeed, it was obscene enough to make a
man become a monk: orgasmic organisms, sensation of void.</p>

Chapter 13</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The glue-induced waves of befuddlement
came to him curled like talons and this twisted and grotesque
inundation beat his shore pulling and pushing bits of himself
fervently in all directions.&#160; It was as his father had told
him often:&#160; he did not know if he was coming or going.&#160;
He was both becoming more conscious of himself and his environment
and yet more despondent with strange thoughts fulminating out of
his living carcass, controlling him. He was moving toward reality
and yet diverging from it.&#160; He believed that he was downtown
with Noppawan and that they were wasting some time before the
meeting with this former avuncular image.&#160; They were walking
through a mall and he was thinking how long ago in boyhood he and
his brothers had entertained the thought of this man really being
family to ease the pain of routine constricting them in
noodles.&#160; In the hallucination they left the mall and went
into an adjacent 80-story building and then took a high-speed
elevator to the top of that skyscraper.&#160; There the couple sat
in the opulence of the Baiyoke Sky Lounge revolving around glass
windows and ordering their cappuccino.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Then he wasn&#8217;t there.&#160; He
was in his room, his cell, staring out of the window. He was
watching a tiger watching the descending sun.&#160; He was
startled.&#160; He hadn't known that animals would look out at the
beauty of a descending sun.&#160; The tiger noticed him and got up;
but discerning this human&#8217;s own benign posture directed
toward the same sunset, the tiger returned to where it was at and
once again revered the sun.&#160; Then he was walking the streets
and feeling such a crazy loneliness.&#160; He began to mutter
nonsense and he felt himself numb and slipping on his own frozen
thoughts. It was very strange for he wasn&#8217;t moving and yet
the streets moved him&#8212;-strange as the fetid one, Kumpee,
having been the angel who had come at the right second delivering
him from his worst impulses to kill Kazem.&#160; If anything had
given him food for thought that week of idleness and recuperation
in his cell, it had been the irony of the fetid one as his guardian
angel.&#160; If the fetid one had not stepped in nothing would have
intervened and he would have murdered his brother or been murdered
by him.&#160; If Suthep had come at that instant, instead of
Kumpee, he would have believed in Buddha or God.&#160; As it was,
he believed in Glue and its power to imitate the strange magic of
the world that was all around him.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; His hallucination took him through the
drenching storms of heavy rains and again to the heavily
billboarded world of downtown opulence where flashing and animated
signs had water flooding over them.&#160; They were of Izuzo
Automobiles, Compaq Computers, and sprawled cursory sentences
advertising self-help and get-rich seminars.&#160; A more
conventional but gigantic billboard placed near a skyscraper was
fully lit and mesmerizing with gigantic faces of beautiful people
with clean and white Chinese skin kept pimpleless with Johnson and
Johnson&#8217;s Clean and Clear.&#160; There were electric rotating
piecemeal signs advertising cellular phones and internet providers
(instantaneous messages not for his patronage). Advertisements were
on the sides of busses and bus stops of happy soap families and
big-breasted bra wearers both of which made the saliva increase in
his mouth the way an orange would. Shop signs crouched low with
sidewalk beggars, international fast food restaurants and flyers
thrust into hands: and it all spoke of the city the same as the
skyscrapers that alone were the epitome of opulence and disparity.
&#8220;What do you want from life?&#8221; said the whore at her
door.&#160; &#8220;Enroll at Siam University and find new
opportunities.&#160; Don&#8217;t let bad grades stop you,&#8221;
she continued.&#160; &#8220;Come in, and I&#8217;ll give you a
massage that will make your body feel in ways you&#8217;ve never
imagined,&#8221; said the shark restaurant worker who made a
commission luring those of supercilious tastes to a cuisine laced
in marginal traces of mercury.&#160; &#8220;Shark Fins this
way,&#8221; said the tuc tuc driver eager to compound a taxi fee
with an agency&#8217;s commission for bringing a foreigner to a
beloved half-hour lady of the night. &#8220;Want a girl?&#8221;
asked the white robed female Buddhist nuns who had shaved heads and
collection canisters in their hands as they stood on the steps
leading to the platform of the sky train like Hara Krishnas.&#160;
Jatupon heard the door open.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Oh, God,&#8221; he heard
Kazem&#8217;s voice. Surprisingly, it wasn&#8217;t angry. He heard
footsteps of restless movement.&#160; &#8220;Oh, God,&#8221; he
heard again.&#160; Then he heard the footsteps move toward
him.&#160; The movements were slow and careful.&#160; He opened his
eyes and saw his brother. Kazem was scratching his head in
confusion.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry buddy.&#160;
I&#8217;m so sorry. I know I&#8217;m late saying that, but fuck,
you were ready to throw a television into my head. I don&#8217;t
know how all that happened, but what a mess.&#160; Why did you have
to get yourself all doped like that at this time&#8212;especially
this time; and oh, fuck, did you get into my whiskey?&#160; You
did, you little thief!&#160; Right?&#160; Right?&#160; Was that a
nod?&#160; Was that a nod? Do you like that?&#160; I&#8217;ll pull
your ears off the way father nearly did.&#160; Man, we&#8217;ve got
an appointment!&#160; Did you take anything besides sniffing this
stuff? I mean besides drinking my liquor and sniffing glue was
there a third thing?&#160; Think:&#160; I&#8217;ve got to know how
serious!&#8221; This had been one of Jatupon&#8217;s only times of
being in the cell and flying within his own head. Nearly all the
other times he had gone out to the streets to gain his high and
stayed there until he was able to return home halfway sober and
feign a sickness successfully. He regretted being witnessed and
scrutinized by Kazem. The environment was bouncing to the cadence
of Kazem&#8217;s voice and stung Jatupon&#8217;s hands through the
conduit of the rubbery stickiness of desiccated glue that still
hung in patches from some of his fingertips. He was pulled into the
shower with underpants still on.&#160; The hair of his head was
locked in Kazem&#8217;s fingers. He could smell the sweetness of
his brother&#8217;s sweat.&#160; He could smell his body odor like
any dog getting its molecular high.&#160; Jatupon thought it was
very romantic.&#160; He smiled widely at Kazem whose fingers
clenched him by the throat pinning him against the back wall of the
shower as the cold waters ran over him and through his underpants.
Jatupon fought like a suffocating fish and when he was free from
the loosened grasp he gasped and then kissed and licked the body
that he was denuding-&#8212;the same body that had brought him near
death but the same one who had saved him from drowning long ago
when he was a boy.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Then after a good long vomit and a
brief nap he exited with his brother into the light rain and they
were off to see the wizard.&#160; They went by taxi with the idea
of picking up Suthep along the way. Kazem waited in the taxi while
Jatupon knocked on Suthep&#8217;s door.&#160; Jatupon knocked,
stood, and waited repeatedly for five or ten minutes without
success.&#160; Then he began to return to the taxi looking down and
scrapping his feet against dirt and rocks like a child preferring
to be left alone in his imagination.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; But when he returned the taxi had
turned into a limousine like a pumpkin into a carriage. He wondered
if he was hallucinating once again.&#160; Then standing there like
a diffident and disconcerted child in total confusion, he noticed
the window descending for him and out poked the head of the fetid
one but his hair was cut, greased back, and nicely groomed, his
face was shaven, and the cologne or aftershave lotion that he was
wearing had molecules that poignantly bit into Jatupon&#8217;s
psyche favorably.&#160; Here was a dark but handsome man.&#160; He
never knew him, before, to be such.&#160; &#8220;Get in you little
Monkey&#8212;-up front with the driver.&#8221; When Jatupon was
seated comfortably in softness and space he glanced back at his
three brothers who reclined in an opulent shadow.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Cheers, Jatuporn,&#8221; said
Kumpee.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Kazem clanged his glass against the
glasses held by Kumpee and Suthep. &#8220;Cheers to every boy,
girl, hollering hound, and wide spread whore on the planet,&#8221;
said Kazem.&#160; Suthep and Kumpee laughed.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll have to say my
cheers to them too,&#8221; said Kumpee.&#160; All three brothers
were drinking wine in the back seat.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Should we give him something?&#8221;
asked Suthep.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Are you kidding,&#8221; said
Kazem.&#160; &#8220;That boy goes places we can only dream
about.&#160; No more fuel for that tank.&#160; He&#8217;s been
there, done that.&#160; He&#8217;s gone on one round trip today.
That&#8217;s enough.&#8221;&#160; He drank more of his wine.&#160;
&#8220;Sometimes I have to sleep with one eye open to make sure he
doesn&#8217;t drift further into mischief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Did you like how we fucked up
your mind?&#8221; Kumpee asked Kazem.&#160; &#8220;It was
Suthep&#8217;s idea of parking on the corner. When you didn&#8217;t
leave the taxi we still waited a little until you fell into a
smoking addiction.&#160; Suthep said, &#8216;Just wait, he&#8217;ll
go into the 7-11&#8217; and that is exactly what happened.&#160;
While you were in there buying your cigarettes we paid off the taxi
driver and sent him away.&#160; Then we parked in his
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Well, if that trick was for me, it
didn&#8217;t do anything.&#160; I wasn&#8217;t even surprised let
alone shocked.&#160; I definitely didn&#8217;t think I was out of
my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Well, Jatuporn sure thought he
was seeing things,&#8221; said Suthep.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;He looked like the Emerald
Buddha was talking to him,&#8221; said Kumpee.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The brothers laughed.&#160; Suthep
farted.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Bangkok bus exhaust.&#160; Plug
your nose,&#8221; commented Kumpee. Their laughter intensified.
Even Jatupon was laughing with them.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I want to know why Jatuporn is
wearing sunglasses,&#8221; said Suthep anxious to diffuse their
thinking of his odor. Horrific odors were usually attributed to
Kumpee and he cared to keep it that way.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You know already,&#8221; said
Kazem. &#8220;Leave it alone.&#160; Why are you wearing that gold
chain around your neck?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;A girl gave it to me&#8221; said
Suthep.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;What girl?&#160; Some girl
behind a cash register.&#160; Did you pull out a gun and make her
believe her brains would be splattered?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t have been
me.&#160; I am a woman lover.&#160; I don&#8217;t make war,&#8221;
said Suthep.&#160; &#8220;Show me your eyes, Jatuporn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Leave him alone,&#8221; said
Kazem.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Kumpee grabbed Jatupon&#8217;s head,
yanked off the glasses, and twisted the face so that Suthep could
see it.&#160; &#8220;A regular raccoon, that one is.&#160;
&#8220;No, even a raccoon is lighter than that.&#160; Maybe
it&#8217;s like watching a raccoon after he and a bear have been
going at it:&#160; the bear with a television in his paws and the
raccoon cowering near his puddle of blood.&#160; Thai boxing
doesn&#8217;t get as exciting as what I saw.&#160; I just regret
not having been there for the whole show.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Stop it!&#8221; ordered
Kazem.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Does he always give orders like
that?&#8221; asked Kumpee to Suthep. Then to Kazem he said,
&#8220;Hey, remember that I am the oldest one here.&#160; Could you
say that in a more pleasant tone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I would like for you to stop
picking on him.&#160; Look at him up there.&#8221; Jatupon&#8217;s
eyes were withdrawn and his head was slightly tilted to the
dashboard.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Here are your glasses,&#8221;
said Kumpee as he stood and bent forward with effort to give them
back. His hand disheveled Jatupon&#8217;s unkempt hair even
further. &#8220;You need to comb that mop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Arrows of the past, mostly from his
father and Kumpee, shot out of the neurological circuitry of his
brain paralyzing him in a numb withdrawal of survival.&#160;&#160;
It was no different than at earlier stages of his life when he
wondered why things didn&#8217;t move forward but at the same time
was fearful that they would.&#160; He was back in the horror known
as family withdrawing himself from it, living in his protective
bubble of withdrawal.&#160; &#8220;You are afraid of your own
shadow.&#8221; &#8220;Are you preparing for a flood?&#160; Those
pants look stupid on you.&#8221;&#160; &#8220;What are you doing
sitting over there?&#160; Get out of that seat?&#8221;&#160;&#160;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll mop up the floor with you one of these
days.&#8221; &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you working?&#160; You are
absolutely good for nothing.&#8221; &#8220;What do you do in that
back room, you pimple faced monkey?&#160; Get out of that cage of
yours and put down those books.&#160; No use you thinking you are
any better than the rest of us.&#8221; &#8220;Get out of my seat
you ugly little fart.&#8221; He heard it even though none of these
disparaging ideas were articulated in the limousine.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jatuporn, Jatuporn, he thought.&#160;
They knew and they mocked him with his ignominy.&#160; If he had
been a girl and someone had sexually abused him he could speak of
it and have a good purifying cry cleansing himself of his stress
but his situation was different.&#160; It was one he had invited
upon himself.&#160; He&#8217;d sleep with the others as well if it
would make them kinder to him&#8212;so vehement was his need for
their love.&#160;&#160; How horrible it was to meet this rich
avuncular stranger, he thought to himself.&#160; It would be
horrible enough meeting a bag lady with a face that looked like a
raccoon and an aching in his raw bottom.&#160; He put on his
sunglasses.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In an odd way for him it was like
traveling on a poor man&#8217;s cattle train back to the town from
whence an exodus from the rice fields had occurred.&#160; No poor
man would want to return to his farm and admit that he
couldn&#8217;t obtain employment in Bangkok and no one with any
real self-esteem wanted to link again to a wealthy man who, for
good reason, had been reluctant to have any association with his
ex-nephews-in-law. His father had tried countless times to get
money from the senator.&#160; His mother had been subtler and more
industrious.&#160; She got a campaign drive active in her
neighborhood to do her little part in trying to get him
reelected.&#160; The senator never forgot such hard working
activists and always remembered her birthday with a gift.&#160; She
was content with that but for her husband it intensified his
yearning for better things.&#160; And so it was with his brothers:
they thought about how their dreams could be effectuated with a bit
of the senator&#8217;s savings. Jatupon did not adhere to this
disingenuous wish for a family reunion and so trapped in a moving
box with brothers who had one converging theme that was not his
own, he felt like an unemployed laborer returning back on the poor
man&#8217;s train even though he was riding in a limousine.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The recurring idea that the aunt and
the uncle had not gone to the funeral made him even increasingly
repellent toward this meeting with the senator.&#160; He halfway
wanted to jump out of the door and let a physics lesson
ensue.&#160; Would he just drop or would he be thrust out like a
projectile. Would his blood ooze out or would it disgorge like the
insides of a tossed pumpkin?&#160; He looked out of the window at
the quick passing of buildings and then up to the billowing
clouds.&#160; They were gas with distinct and individual
form.&#160; They were energy that was distended and
fomenting.&#160; How mysterious it all was. When one was cremated
he would be such gas. Man was ephemeral noise but nature was
reticent and swelling.&#160; Distending and distending, it extended
him beyond his petty thinking.&#160; How good it all was!&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;Well, he thought, there was no
resisting of the inevitable.&#160; He would be entering the
senator&#8217;s house mortified from his sunglasses and black eyes
but the issue was petty enough that there would not be any serious
consideration about avoiding this eventuality through jumping out
of a moving car. Kazem had attempted to put a story into his head
that might save them from being scrutinized about this
subject.&#160; It had seemed plausible enough: an injury from the
recent Songkran festival in Banglampool gained from a water fight
where some water in the plastic guns had been adulterated with some
caustic chemicals.&#160; However, he did not like casting shadowy
illusions into the senator&#8217;s mighty halls.&#160; No, he
shouldn&#8217;t be with this chain gang of prisoners going to the
warden&#8217;s home, dragging the noodles that bound them, asking
for him to remove them.&#160; This avuncular stranger hadn&#8217;t
come for their parents&#8217; funeral.&#160; He hadn&#8217;t wished
them condolences.&#160; It would have been such a little thing to
do; and since it wasn&#8217;t done it was monumentally wrong.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Reticent and deep in himself so that
his brothers&#8217; pejorative comments did not hurt him
tremendously when they pierced, he implemented the same defense
mechanism that had saved him from psychosis in such a family all of
these years. This withdrawal made the rational self into a deadened
membrane and shield.&#160; This shield deflected their arrows. How
profoundly intricate the psyche&#8217;s defenses were.&#160; What
wouldn&#8217;t the brain do to spare itself of wounds!&#160; The
mind, perhaps, did the same with love.&#160; Within life&#8217;s
physical titillations in this sordid realm through the smell and
feel of breath rhythmically sliding onto his nose from the spewing
mouth of his mate &#8212;-a warm soothing wind crossing the hill of
his nose; the tactile wearing of another&#8217;s skin by touch more
luxurious than any silk; merciful orgasmic clemency from logic; the
moving of a chest; the heart beat; and yes, the feeling of being in
love addictive and sensitive toward another human presence,
one&#8217;s ideas of life were whitewashed and exhilarated. For
him, sex in the shower had annulled his hatred of Kazem.&#160; It
had made the world into less of a hostile place. It had provided
the specious idea that he was not alone. He looked out of the car
window.&#160; The palm trees seemed like rock solid Cyclopes eating
away the remnants of the sun.&#160; He noticed that the car was
stopping. The gates opened to an acreage far from balloon peddlers,
sandwich salesmen with a box strapped onto their chests, holy
jasmine makers, goldfish in the bag mountebanks, car window
newspaper accosters, and the sidewalk noodle workers.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Will he be alone?&#8221; asked
Suthep.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;His staff will be there,&#8221;
said Kumpee.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I mean women.&#160; An Old guy
with lots of money must have new ones around each week.&#160; I
mean they wouldn&#8217;t like him but they would feel important and
ornamental to be there at his home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t know one way or
the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;What did you do when you
were together with him?&#8221; asked Suthep.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t really.&#160; It
was through a speaker.&#160; I finally got him to talk through the
speaker after pleading with all his servants that way.&#160; I made
him feel guilty.&#160; I told him he should have gone to the
funeral.&#160; I told him he needed to help his relatives or
I&#8217;d see if a newspaper reporter would talk to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You said that!&#8221; yelled
Kazem angrily.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Oh, he agreed with me that he
was wrong.&#160; He said that he wanted to see us.&#160; He told me
that.&#160; Then we got visits from his men and this.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When they arrived into what was to them
an opulent mansion (a couple of the dozen rooms that were only
marginally spacious by western standards) they saw him in the
living room in front of a big screen where, what to the gods, were
tenuous carbon copies of men falling from the windows of a
skyscraper with their myriad papers.&#160; America (specifically
New York City) was under siege.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The boys gestured the
&#8220;wei&#8221; to him.&#160; He saw prayerful hands in front of
faces and, except in the youngest who was hidden behind his
sunglasses, their beggarly downtrodden expressions depicted their
unworthiness to meet him. That was their ploy. He gestured the
&#8220;wei&#8221; in return. He was begrudging of their entrance in
his life and resented having to comply with the wishes of the
eldest that the meeting take place.&#160; However, his plan was to
neutralize the possibility of negative publicity.&#160; He just
wanted to allow these meetings to take place from time to
time.&#160; If the &#8220;thugs&#8221; thought that he would be
giving them anything more than an occasional meal it was their own
delusion and in the meantime he would be keeping any problems from
occurring like the unlikely eventuality of an newspaper article
scathing him for lack of interest in the welfare of his relatives
and making an assumption that he wouldn&#8217;t be interested in
the welfare of others.&#160; Something like that, unlikely as it
was, could nonetheless happen if he didn&#8217;t pacify those who
had the power to possibly create such problems.&#160; &#8220;Come
in and sit down over here,&#8221; he said.&#160; The tone of voice
of this avuncular stranger was grave and his face hardly glanced at
them as their barefooted feet ascended into his domain. The
television tugged in their diffident movements to plush, white,
upholstered chairs and these chairs kept saying to Jatupon that he
and his brothers had no right to sit there. Still and seated, they
became like spectators at the Coliseum.&#160; It was a CNN glimpse
into the future: skyscrapers ablaze from passenger jets
deliberately being slammed into them.&#160; They were being made
aware of horrific ways of dying and since it was so horrific there
was no self-centeredness and movement by which to callously
disregard it.&#160; They were empathic and there was no
escape.&#160; Jatupon wanted to shake the gods from their slumber,
to knock the emerald Buddha from its pedestal, and to hijack fate
and turn it around at gunpoint from the cockpit.&#160; He wanted
all life to cease and start again in parity and respect.&#160; He
wanted deliverance for Siriaj Hospital freaks, the aborted, the
stillborn, deformed, diseased, and the downtrodden, those who die
from malnutrition, old men who always think that their lives have
been for nothing, the elephants that lose their molars and so
search for a soft shaded area of grass to lie down in comfortable
death, weaker animals not yet dead fallen as prey, soldiers who
must lose their lives in war, and child soldiers whose short lives
were as instruments of hate.&#160; To him it was no wonder that
they (humans) were bad.&#160; They were all conceived by greedy
sexual devouring, these selfish absorptions and attempts at fitting
into silk skinned robes and hallucinogenic shadows.&#160; The World
Trade Center disaster was proof not only that people were bad but
that there was no god overseer above looking at this clashing of
wills.&#160; There was just malicious and inane preying on others
and this time it might well be that these hijackers had not even
been incensed at opulence and starvation which stood back to back
like America and Afghanistan or a domineering state like America to
a stateless one like Palestine.&#160; If this had been planned by
the rich ex-Saudi, Bin Laden, it was just hate (senseless,
irrational hate that existed for no particular reason at all), the
desire for power, the idea of heroism and a sure ticket to heaven,
and the dramatic thrill of destruction that would go down as
historical.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It was strange that people should
perish so terribly and that those perpetrating this action could
rationalize America as a monster worthy of monstrous actions that
would humble this one nation under God, indivisible with liberty
and justice for all.&#160; Foremost it was strange to him that such
suffering could be ignored, if not partially forgotten so quickly
when Vanont, the servant, came in for the third time telling them
that the dinner was getting cold and he wasn&#8217;t going to warm
it up for the second time.&#160; No longer mesmerized, they came
back to themselves. At the dining room table they began their banal
chatter. They asked about the number of his servants, how long he
had lived here, his typical working day, and what he did when he
returned home.&#160; They wanted to ask about their aunt but they
had determined as they rode over here that the subject might
alienate their host. Except for Jatupon whose lips slightly
frowned, the brothers gained pleasure pointing out various items in
the room, asking questions about them, and feeling pleased to be in
such opulence.&#160; The senator asked about Kazem and
Suthep&#8217;s restaurant businesses.&#160; When Suthep made a more
obvious attack to evoke sympathy for their nominal existence the
senator said, &#8220;You are young.&#160; It is a first
business.&#8221; Then to avert hearing anything more on that
matter, he switched to Kumpee who had extorted this family
reunion.&#160; He asked what he did for a living.&#160;
Kumpee&#8217;s circumlocutory answer was no different than any
hustler&#8217;s grandiloquence about selling one thing or another
real or imagined.&#160; His quick words were inarticulate and
glib.&#160; Nobody understood what he said for the words were
mountainous heaps of illusion.&#160; The senator did find out that
Kumpee had fathered a child.&#160; He had a baby girl.&#160; Kumpee
took out the photograph from his wallet and then he passed it
around.&#160; The senator affected a smile when he saw the picture
but he conjectured that &#8220;this boy&#8221; was living from this
arrangement with the girlfriend and the baby he had fathered.&#160;
Jatupon, surprised like his other siblings, found pleasure in the
thought that he was now an uncle.&#160; For a moment he felt love
for this unseen entity and a desire to ensure that her life turned
out better than his but then he realized that he would never see
her, and being the child of a rich Chinese Thai, she would have a
better life than he had.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The senator asked Jatupon why he was
wearing sunglasses.&#160; He gave the rehearsed answer and then had
to remove the sunglasses at the senator&#8217;s insistence.&#160;
&#8220;The Songkran festival ended over a month ago,&#8221; said
the avuncular stranger.&#160; &#8220;Why do you still have black
eyes now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes, but my face was really hurt
badly&#8221; Jatupon responded.&#160; The senator looked at him
sternly.&#160; He didn&#8217;t want to waste his night hearing
their lies, and if they were all like Suthep, he didn&#8217;t want
to hear the truths either.&#160; Kazem opened his mouth.&#160; He
was prepared to say that Jatupon had gotten himself into a fight
but when he saw the stern expression of the unbelieving&#160;&#160;
host his words retreated.&#160; Jatupon saw himself and his
brothers shaded in the dismal gray of those who could not be
trusted.&#160; A man&#8217;s mind was a tenuous object swayed in
the winds of discourse so when it sensed a disingenuous response in
the surreal uncertainty of understanding a matter fully it
cringed.&#160; He felt like he was casting shadows onto the
senator&#8217;s grand walls like children using their hands to
project shadows of rabbits and dogs.&#160; But then his conscience
waned. He again remembered that the aunt and uncle hadn&#8217;t
attended the funeral of his parents.&#160; He remembered his
aunt&#8217;s magnanimous crusades to become so important in his
life, seeing him educated by paying his tuition and sending him to
private tutorials, the Bible school, the varnishing of
Christ&#8217;s picture on wood, the taste of punch at the Bible
School, and how outside the building there was a soccer ball tied
to a string and a pole and how the children tried to compete to get
the ball wound up on their side of the poll.&#160; She would
sometimes come to pick him up and take him to an ice cream
parlor.&#160; She didn&#8217;t have any children of her own.&#160;
He frowned at the senator&#8217;s scolding facial
expressions.&#160; He met angered glances with those of his own.
The family chatted on.&#160; The senator seemed friendlier and
Jatupon even began to look up from his plate.&#160; The distrust
had diffused to the point where it ceased to matter.&#160; They
chatted and their chatter was irrelevant.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why did this happen?&#8221;
blurted out Jatupon from nowhere.&#160; &#8220;If it is Islamic
terrorists how could they hate that badly?&#160; Is it envy of a
wealthier and more powerful country, or the hatred toward Israeli
aid from the United States?&#160; I don&#8217;t understand
it.&#160; We talk and talk and yet people are falling out of
windows of 100 story buildings.&#160; How can we eat and carry on
with things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Kumpee and Suthep scoffed at him.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;It is barbaric, barbaric no
matter what line of reasoning they use to justify their
actions.&#160; Do you know anything about the Islamic world and why
it dislikes the west, Jatupon?&#8221;&#160; The choice of his words
were influenced by his Moslem background.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t really,&#8221; he
said. &#8220; If Bin Laden is so rich it isn&#8217;t inequality
that he hates. Tyrants like building up empires but he
doesn&#8217;t seem to want one-- just wants to destroy the
west.&#160; I don&#8217;t understand it at all.&#160; I know that
there are 7000 American soldiers in the holy land of Saudi Arabia
to protect that area from Iraq&#8217;s aggression and&#8212;&#8220;
He swallowed hard.&#160; He knew that his brothers would hate
him.&#160; &#8220;I know that America continues to supply Israel
with millions of dollars in aid and billions of dollars in weapon
sales even though Israel still occupies what was once
Palestine.&#8221;&#160; He knew that he needed to summarize these
issues with some scanty understanding to impress the senator.&#160;
&#8220;America imposes sanctions against Iraq out of fear of its
military buildup but these sanctions cause thousands of people to
die from malnutrition.&#160; America financially backed Iraq
against Iran in that war and the Teleban against the Soviet Union
and now those regimes were the wrong choices. The enemy of my enemy
is my friend was the wrong philosophy.&#160; Those were bad foreign
affairs blunders.&#160; They continually interfere with the
policies of Moslem countries so that the oil that drives their
economy doesn&#8217;t cease. It is economic considerations that
cause them to back the governments of Algeria and Egypt that they
can influence even though those governments are not democracies.
They&#8217;ve made Iraq and Iran as strong as America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The senator knew that this was a good
understanding for a 14-year-old boy.&#160; &#8220;How do you know
these things, Jatupon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;He reads a lot of comic
books,&#8221; said Suthep.&#160; They laughed.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I go to the library when I
can,&#8221; he said modestly.&#160; &#8220;Sometimes I go there
just to read comic books and once in a while I read
Newsweek.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Do you know English?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; he said
proudly.&#160; The senator found himself interested in the boy the
way his ex-wife had been. Her reasons, however, had been maternal
ones and her disinterest had been from the same source.&#160; A
voice of an alter ego that was fettered in a private chamber in the
cellar of her mind shrieked stridently that this was no child of
her own and it had been for this reason that she had dropped him
from her life suddenly.&#160; His interest was of a man who sees
continuum of what he is or a rejuvenation of what he was.&#160;
Both reactions were selfish ones but this was the planet Earth
where most good actions were dictated by egocentric realms.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Vanont yelled that one of the buildings
was imploding and the senator got up from the table.
&#8220;Continue eating,&#8221; he said as he exited the room.
Jatupon looked out of the window.&#160; Thai thunder crackled the
skies like an empty bag of potato chips.&#160; Lightning streaked
across the Thai skies naked and ominous. There he was seated with
his brothers in that home they had always wanted to enter for so
many years.&#160; And yet instead of being the happy family members
visiting the relatives, they were nothing but a group of
extortionists who had manipulated their way through locked gates.
This fraternity of boyhood had evolved on higher tiers of wants
into a Tower of Babel, a tower of thugs.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Low levels of hate still exuded from
him toward Kazem who had done this to his face.&#160; He was
sedentary in his own guilt for his attempt to murder Kazem, which
later led to the best sexual experience he had ever had. Hate and
the frenzy of love were rotting the best aspects of him that was so
neatly named a soul.&#160; Hate and love had been horrible
fulminations of neediness that ignited a person into another being,
possessed will, and thrust reality into chaos.&#160; Sure this
release of sexual tension, in the acme of ecstasy, led to Nirvana
like any well thrust missile but each intimacy was like a cow that
jumped over the moon.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He heard his brothers talk but did not
listen to anything.&#160; Talk was a kinetic sport. The mouth was a
spout. In it emotions were like boiling water steaming out the
teapot. For him, the introvert who communed with the original
wisdom deep in the stagnant pool of his being, there was only the
window and a landscape of waxy greenery in the rain.&#160; He was
mesmerized in the mellifluous monotony of rain slapping against the
window.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Men falling from the windows of the
World Trade Center in New York: the world was an evil place and he
wanted to sink under the veil of Childhood for it was benign.&#160;
Guileless, ingenuous, innocuous, worriless childhood was where the
imagined was tangible and personal.&#160; Planes deliberately
crashed into skyscrapers incinerating buildings and people: this
was solid proof that it was a godless universe, but then he had
always assumed that it was such.&#160; Still to take a deep breath
was amazing.&#160; To be thinking was amazing. To see from the
window such a beautiful verdant acreage and rain pouring onto it
making it greener yet was like fecund life commencing after the
destruction of a forest fire. His parents died but in so doing here
he was in the senator&#8217;s dining room: wasn&#8217;t this an
amazing chain of events even if their arrival had been obtained
badly?&#160; The senator called them to come in with their plates
and drinks.&#160; For Jatupon it felt like they were a family
huddled together in front of the television&#8212;-images of
tragedy shared together in common.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A half hour later the senator found
himself irritated by the one likable thug looking the part.&#160;
&#8220;Can you see anything with those sunglasses on?&#8221; he
asked bitterly.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Not much&#8221; said
Jatupon.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen what you look
like.&#160; Take them off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Take them off you little
idiot&#8221; said Kumpee.&#160; Jatupon obeyed but glanced at
Kumpee with a strong glare of hate.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Did you really get that from
Songkran?&#8221; asked the senator.&#160; Jatupon sensed that the
senator&#8217;s tone was jocular.&#160; He could tell that the
avuncular stranger, like them all, just needed a respite from the
grave images they were witnessing.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;He&#8217;s always getting into
fights&#8221; lied Kumpee stealing the words that still
wouldn&#8217;t come from Kazem&#8217;s mouth.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Is that so?&#8221; asked the
senator but it was to no one specific.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;All the time&#8221; confirmed
Suthep.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Is that true?&#8221; the senator
asked Jatupon.&#160; &#8220;Who with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine who.&#160;
I guess myself,&#8221; said Jatupon while he stared into the
senator&#8217;s eyes with a bold earnestness.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The senator laughed&#160;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll interpret that as a need for privacy,&#8221; he
said.&#160; He backed away from the truth.&#160; He sensed it
already and it was really none of his business.&#160; In a strange
way he was even beginning to like their presence.&#160; It was the
closest thing he had to family, and so he told himself that maybe
he should enjoy it.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jatupon looked out across the
senator&#8217;s spacious living room and then returned to the
center where they were.&#160; He noticed a bowl on an end
table.&#160; The bowl contained wrapped caramel within
it.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#8220;Help yourself,&#8221; said the
senator as he passed the bowl first to Kumpee who was seated
nearest to him.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; They chewed.&#160; The senator
continued translating pertinent bits that were anchored on the news
program.&#160; &#8220;America under attack&#8221; was the logo at
the bottom of the screen.&#160; The brothers had no label for this
snack but they knew that it was catered to the higher status of
palate and because of this they ate it gluttonously.&#160; The
taste and the gummy texture were foreign to them.&#160; Jatupon
thought of his own insatiable need for sweets any time he saw his
aunt.&#160; If she continued to buy candy necklaces for him to
slobber on she continued to care and it was for that reason that he
craved for sweets so voraciously.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;The wrappers are labeled with the
names of American states on them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes, I like caramel. I always have
since Chusanee and I were married.&#160; She liked them so much.
Anyhow that&#8217;s over now.&#160; By the way, I&#8217;m not sure
if you know this, Jatupon, but after your mother and father
separated briefly, your mother went away to the states. You were
born in America.&#8221; Jatupon sat there in numb surprise with a
caramel square smashed into the back of his mouth.&#160; He
didn&#8217;t chew or swallow as the senator elaborated on a trip
that their aunt had arranged for their mother to give her some time
to think.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m mentioning it to you now because
you are American and you should know that fact if ever you have an
opportunity to travel. It is easier with an American
passport.&#8221;&#160; Then his face focused on the images.&#160; A
second tower imploded.&#160; How many thousands were dead and dying
was anyone&#8217;s guess. It was a horrible thing and yet he felt
that they all, rightly or wrongly, were linked together in the
belief that gluttony and poverty were the main instigators.&#160;
He wondered if his brothers thought that justice was being
rendered.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Later, when Jatupon was returning from
the bathroom, Vanont stopped him and asked him to go into the
study.&#160; Ten minutes later the senator came in and sat down at
his desk.&#160; He handed Jatupon a can of Coca Cola.&#160; The
senator had a second one that he also opened and drank.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Why do you think that your
brothers have been so persistent about seeing me?&#8221; asked the
senator.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know for sure.
That&#8217;s the truth. I don&#8217;t think there is anything too
planned in it. They&#8217;re selfish.&#160; I know that.&#160; It
was wrong how Kumpee arranged the meeting.&#160; Even Kazem thinks
that; but it isn&#8217;t so calculating for a bunch of boys with no
real family&#8212;-not even with each other--to want to know their
uncle.&#160; I know that you aren&#8217;t married now and it
isn&#8217;t as if you are an uncle like blood or have to have
anything to do with us. Anyhow I think more than anything they just
wanted to meet someone respectable when their lives aren&#8217;t of
any consequence.&#160; At least that is how I feel about it.&#160;
Maybe they think that they can get something out of it but I
don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve really isolated what they
want.&#160; Maybe it isn&#8217;t much more than just wanting to
feel a bit linked to you.&#160; I guess I want that in ways, but in
ways I don&#8217;t.&#160; I mean you&#8217;ve been really nice but
I don&#8217;t understand why you didn&#8217;t go to my
parents&#8217; funeral.&#160; There was nobody really but us.&#160;
Nobody came at all really.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Maybe I should help you,&#8221;
said the senator.&#8221; The words ran out of his mouth like a
loose dog.&#160; He was surprised to see them running away. Jatupon
could see that he regretted the words.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I need out. I don&#8217;t mean
to come here with you.&#160; I want, on my own, to break from them.
I can&#8217;t go back there again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Which one beat up on you like
that?&#8221;&#160; Jatupon didn&#8217;t say anything but looked
down at his legs.&#160; The senator asked, &#8220;Does it happen
very often?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not a
kid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;re 14, aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Well, that isn&#8217;t
manhood yet.&#160; It is an awkward age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8220;I won&#8217;t
return.&#160; I hate him for doing that to me.&#160; He just left
me in the puddle of my blood.&#160; I hated him so badly I wanted
to kill him afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Which one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;All of them hate me.&#160;
Suthep and Kumpee resented what Aunt Chusanee tried to do for me
but I don&#8217;t hate them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;She always said that you were
clever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I wish I could go away and be
somebody different than what I am, and yet I wish that I could be
important to them and that the four of us could be a close family.
You too, if you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Jatupon, families aren&#8217;t
forever.&#160; Boys grow up and they gain their own lives.&#160;
They have children.&#160; Those children grow up.&#160; I
don&#8217;t know what you might or might not have done to get into
a fight with them or one of them but it didn&#8217;t deserve a fist
in your face.&#160; You look awful.&#160; Give me a week.&#160; I
want you to contact me in a week. I&#8217;ve got some work I need
to do and Vanont will show you and your brothers out.&#160;
He&#8217;ll point you in the direction of the bus stop.&#160; It
isn&#8217;t all that late.&#160; All the busses should still be
running.&#160; Tell your brothers that we&#8217;ll try to get
together again in a couple months or so.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; From the window of the classroom,
Noppawan saw the wind kick about the branches of the trees in an
anomaly not characteristic of Bangkok weather.&#160; She hated
feeling hostage to proctor the eye movements of these students, to
walk every several minutes through the aisles of the desks, and to
scrutinize wanton little individuals prepossessed of schemes for
cheating that could improve their chances of getting good grades
and hasten the end of the tests.&#160; Their main wishes were for
the</p>

<p>resurrection of their still cadavers to the kinetic movement of
going with their friends to the next Hollywood movie, the next
shrill of laughter, gossip, and karaoke booths in the corridors of
malls. She liked the wind&#8217;s attitude of just knocking around
the day, kicking off the old leaves, and dancing about.&#160; She
wondered why she admired kinetic movement in nature and not in the
uniformed idiocy of the students before her.&#160; It was, she
answered to herself, because each of these uniformed specimens
probably did the same exact actions of their fathers and mothers
before them.&#160; Certainly year after year new groups of freshmen
were identical to each other. They engaged in senseless programmed
activities like ants: the mating frivolity before working and
hording.&#160; As rich as they were (these future owners of their
parents&#8217; factories) they were walking down the same hill
toward their deaths no different than the worker ants.&#160; None
of them contributed to the permanency of thought and
understanding.&#160; They just followed and followed.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Nature experimented, she caused
uniqueness in form if not attitude, she continentally drifted lands
for the hell of it, she erupted volcanoes and earthquakes in the
damnedest of places and let her creatures adapt or perish.&#160;
Nature was an alchemist and a lover of the extraordinary.&#160;
Noppawan wanted to open a window.&#160; After all, the students
were cold in the air conditioning and she wanted to feel the
breeze, but some fool or another who supervised proctors would
complain that something in the room wasn&#8217;t orthodox.&#160;
She didn&#8217;t want to get a letter in her mailbox complaining
that she hadn&#8217;t sealed up the envelopes of the tests with
enough tape or another odd irrelevant idea because she hadn&#8217;t
been as orthodox as she should have been.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It was the administration that
consisted of desperate fools during times that were
irregular.&#160; She had been forced to teach an anthropology class
this semester.&#160; How that was related to zoology she
couldn&#8217;t say unless the administration was privy to the
philosophy of mice and men. All she knew was that the anthropology
teacher ran away and they were in desperate need of someone to fill
the gap as well as perform her regular duties.&#160; A numb
throbbing of life&#8217;s dreariness overtook her as she walked
around these handsome faces and thought to herself how she really
wanted to open the window.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Her husband had not throbbed his body
in her inordinately so she did not understand why she was jealous
of his activities, and yet she was. It was this beyond all other
things that was a gloom over her sedentary thoughts that were
constricted to monitor the eye movements and actions of the
students and to be the perfect guard of these prisoners that had
been assigned to her. She looked at the girl test takers.&#160;
Unlike Porn, whose focus was business, they were disrespectful
whores whose interest was only in sucking up the pheromone fumes,
having babies, and raising them to fulfill their need for stability
and permanence.&#160; To have a role in the world (that of being a
mother) would override the love needs of the contributor of the
sperm, and they would cling to motherhood as salamanders in the
rain.&#160; That&#160; &#8220;salamander in the rain&#8221; idea
had been one of her husband&#8217;s more clever thoughts that he
attributed to the lack of creativity he saw around him.&#160; He
was clever and she had liked him so much for so many years. She
hadn&#8217;t been in love with him until his departure.&#160; If
she had been like all other women she would have succumbed to these
feelings and thoughts that she needed her man terribly. Their
overwhelming power tried to destroy her resolve and only the idea
that these feelings were illusions was she able to maintain her
integrity. The feelings were unadulterated neediness because of his
adultery&#8212;the jealous biological programming of a woman. This
feeling of love, this motif of women and pop culture, vexed
her.&#160; It was annulling her marital contract that had been
engendered out of friendship of two people who were complete unto
themselves.&#160; Well, he wasn&#8217;t so complete.&#160; He did
whine.&#160; That was for sure.&#160; There was a boy that came out
from time to time needing a mommy.&#160; It had been nauseating to
tolerate to say the least; but she had done so under the firm
belief that most men were worse than he was on this point. And for
her, there were female vulnerabilities but earlier she had been
prudent enough to get herself sterilized and minimized her sexual
activity.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Before she came into the
classroom she had encountered a couple of her colleagues laughing
shyly.&#160; In the couple seconds that she drew near them before
passing they were tacit in the shamefaced ways of Thais. She knew
that many of them gossiped about her who was the wife of a man
celebrated for his adulterous debauchery.&#160; She could have been
their holy martyr as the object of sympathy and&#160; the icon of
women&#8217;s suffering but her frank endorsement of her
husband&#8217;s activities to newspaper reporters had made her the
subject of ridicule.&#160; A man would be totally lost if he
didn&#8217;t have his extramarital affairs, she said.&#160; He
would have no knowing of the nothingness of his misadventures
unless he were to experience minutes of despair after the orgasm
was complete.&#160; This is what she told the reporters on a few
occasions&#8212;each time expanding on her ideas and making them
more colorful than at previous times.&#160; She was proud of
creating the Noppawan doctrine and she knew that because of it the
university wanted to get rid of her.&#160; In ways she was proud of
being sneered at but it was uncomfortably lonely. She imagined the
thoughts of these two instructors who passed her, &#8220;Craggy
thing, no man would mount you. It is no wonder that you&#8217;re
forlorn for the whores.&#8221; No, they&#8217;d never even say
anything like that even to each other. They wouldn&#8217;t even
consciously think it. Thais were too polite and too deferential to
even the despised for that: instead there was that shamefaced laugh
and that reciprocal glance.&#160;&#160; Then, as she was walking to
Building P with the tests that she had picked up from the
administration office, a boy and a girl were in front of her.&#160;
This pair, holding hands, were taking up the whole sidewalk and
blocking everyone from passing in their slow movements.&#160; The
girl had books on her head that she was trying to balance.&#160;
The boy watched her lovingly.&#160; She wanted to smack
them&#8212;these dummies who were dopamine gluttons.&#160;
Everywhere she went it was young couples in love.&#160; She wanted
to get out the biggest can of Raid and perform a major
insecticide/genocide that would give Miloshevik a companion in the
Hague; but being a humane individual such hideous thoughts could
only instigate a wry smile or an occasional chuckle.&#160; When she
saw such couples everywhere it made her feel an antithesis of
things: like an uncomfortable young girl experiencing the wetness
of blood being absorbed into her tampons for the first time and as
of a 26 year old tripping around in her days with an old woman
inside of her.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This subject she was proctoring was
business law, a subject so unrelated to her field.&#160; She
unfastened a sheet of paper that was posted on the window and
looked at this list of student names. She matched their
identification cards to the list of names and got each of their
signatures. Weird ideas took over her brain as she looked into
their faces one by one and at their photographs on their student
identification cards.&#160; &#8220;Surawit ,without glasses you
would be as ugly as with them; Wilawan, that bun of a pony tail is
one thing that has just got to go; Sira, you have nice swarthy skin
so fuckable but that nose is like it came from the days when wild
boars used to roam the whole planet&#8212;totally obscene and
pugnacious; Kanoknant, really are you the same girl in this picture
I.D?&#160; How strange! It looks like your older sister and you
look like you&#8217;d be one of the proud little girls who possess
one of these book bags near the white board with&#160; little
stuffed animals dangling from them&#8212;oh, god, I bet your
parents hold their heads in chagrin after giving birth to
you;&#160; Pornpitcha, ya&#8217; frizzed orange hair is of a disco
queen; Wiliwan playing beauty shop with your pony tail&#8212;better
on yourself than on other girls since that is the usual
preoccupation in classes; Pawisar, wouldn&#8217;t that fat face be
less obtrusive if your hair was put in a pony tail&#8212;well,
maybe not&#8230;maybe it would be worse but still that hair is
dangling into your face distracting you from taking the test and
more importantly looking downright uncouth and stringy; Ekkachai,
you certainly have a long tie&#8212;I wonder how big your penis
gets.&#8221;&#160; Those thoughts droned on and on in the same
pattern of crude novelty.&#160;</p>

Chapter 14</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Restless
in the dewy grass of the hard ground, he was asleep. His dreams
registered what, numb, he hadn&#8217;t comprehended so well the
previous evening. His brain rehashed those images surreal and slow:
Vanont slipping them a thousand baht; the decision on the sidewalk
to go to the whores; Kumpee saying that he, Jatupon, was a ladyboy
and couldn&#8217;t go with them as if he had wanted to go with them
(He might have wanted to go but not with them and not with that
thousand baht); his numb malevolent smile at their laughter; being
handed some loose change to go home with; and then getting on a bus
randomly, handing the ticket tearer ten baht and pretending to be
mute and dumb when asked his destination since there was
none.&#160; He hadn&#8217;t even said goodbye to his brothers and
all of those years together.&#160; He just contemptuously smiled at
their contempt and disappeared. One day he would be in
America.&#160; In time, he told himself, in time.&#160; Being the
cockroach had passed in time. He had lived in the world as that of
an insect all those years. These family members didn&#8217;t even
have to ferret out his miserable little existence to stomp on him
daily.&#160; It hadn&#8217;t been much of a sport just to see him
scurry around in the same space within his pain and yet it had been
their main preoccupation.&#160; Bad as it was, it had passed
without the necessity to kill himself. He just said to himself that
it would pass and it had.&#160; He was no ladyboy. Maybe his
serious intensity made his limbs rigid and his movements
circumspect and gauche. Maybe it was strange that he rarely walked
with his brothers but instead walked behind them.&#160; Undoubtedly
he had been the sexual recipient. Still that didn&#8217;t make him
into a ladyboy nor did it make him gay. He was liberated.&#160; He
was a changing creation.&#160; Past actions did not have to define
him. The word, ladyboy, for once did not hurt him deeply since he
was undergoing the metamorphosis of manhood. Manhood was
indefinable since it could be anything one slipped off and slipped
on at will during times that were critical junctures, as he knew
this was.&#160; If he were to go back to Kazem or scurry over to
the senator so begrudging innate inclinations to help him, he would
be a man but a dependent one with childish yearnings to be shaped
by others.&#160; He told himself he would smell like the fetid one,
he would let the sagging elasticity completely peel off his
underwear embarrassingly, and he would eat stray cats in the park
but he would not sacrifice his newly discovered integrity for the
sake of comfort.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the early light of morning he
woke up with maximum determination despite the lack of solid sleep
and seeing that his new home was on the outskirts of a park.&#160;
It was a grassy fringe that went behind the wall and gate that
enclosed the actual park.&#160; The sprinkling of rain was falling
onto him and he could smell the stink of his damp shirt as if the
metamorphosis to manhood had made him into the fetid one.&#160;
Behind the wall he heard the squeaking chains of empty swings being
moved slowly in the wind.&#160; Cars that infrequently passed the
park were unreal and eerie as descending ghosts. No sooner had he
awakened than a middle-aged woman in a red jacket rode up beside
him on her bicycle.&#160; &#8220;Fortunte teller?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No,&#8221; said Jatupon.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want your
fortune read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No,&#8221; he said. He knew he
didn&#8217;t have one.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I teach English too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No,&#8221; said Jatupon.&#160;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t have anything for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Here.&#160; Give this to someone
who needs it.&#8221;&#160; She gave him a business card that was
nothing but a sliver of paper with a computer printed, reduced, and
photocopied message of Thai on one side and English on the other.
In her palm she had a whole stack of these tiny square bits of
paper.&#160; As she rode away he read the English.&#160;
&#8220;Nattanat&#160; near Lumpini Park.&#160; (13:00-21:00) Office
3761/296 soi Yudee 9 Chan Road Tambon Bangko, Kate Bangkolaem, BKK
10120 Thailand.&#160; Tel.02-673-1436&#160; Time call 04.00 AM or
after 10.00 PM&#160; Fortune Teller: I give you many gifts&#160; I
am teacher English teacher/ Thai language&#160; Ride big
bicycle.&#8221; She was one of the lucky ones.&#160; Occasionally
she probably was able to find a foreigner who wanted to learn Thai
and each day she was able to give some fortunes that allowed her to
have her own little room and a telephone.&#160; Thin as she was,
she was able to live even if, in part, she had to seek clients in
the beggars themselves. He waited around for the park to
open.&#160; Slipping into numbness with nothing industrious to do,
his integrity was shaken. He didn&#8217;t want to be here.&#160; He
could still go back to Kazem, he told himself.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Kazem had always been
&#8220;kind&#8221; in the respect that he had domineered over him
and protected him from harm except for times when he harmed him;
and this interestingly contradictory reality was what made their
relationship more sexy and beguiling the way a similar one might
beguile a battered woman in love to have more sex and children
despite her wish to leave him.&#160; Sex (heterosexual or
homosexual, conventional or incestuous) was a passion of frenzy
based on pleasure bonding and emotional dependency, an inordinate
amount of semen and sperm needing to be ejaculated especially after
a few days of sexual abstinence, and force and self-consumption in
a hunger to defy aloneness in rhythmic banging and basic
hedonism.&#160; Kazem was strong and being a force that could
reckon with the world physically, he engendered in others an
instinct rife in interpreting powerful figures such as him as a
prime breeding experience.&#160; A kind individual could never
elicit the same response.&#160; For Jatupon a muscular presence
that could harm him oozed not only a pheromone but triggered in him
a yearning to breed with a prime specimen who asserted his will. If
he had been a woman a baby of this kind might well be
created.&#160; It would be a baby who would become a man well
equipped to survive and be sexy enough to perpetuate another
generation of this kind and deep in the psyche of every human was
that wish to breed with the best physical specimens.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This being &#8220;in love&#8221; was an
addictive rush and despite his mental convictions, his body craved
for the beloved.&#160; Still one night had totally passed without
him and there would be others.&#160; The time on the ground had
been uncomfortable but he knew he could be inured to it.&#160; He
could numb himself to survive and it wouldn&#8217;t be all that
bad. This wound Kazem had given him was a blackening of perspective
as well as the eye.&#160; It was the only gift he had really given
him: the gift of maturity.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He did not know what he was to do with
the day.&#160; Was he to spend the last of his baht on bags of
breadcrumbs that, like an old man, he was to spread out for his
friends, the pigeons?&#160; He paid a couple baht at a public
bathroom.&#160; After relieving himself, he took a partial bath by
cleaning part of his upper body in a sink.&#160; Then he went into
a booth that had a faucet, which leaked water into an Asian style
toilet. Through effort he was able to catch some of the water
before it went into this urinal that was embedded into the floor.
He was able to wash off a bit of his lower extremities by these
sprinkles.&#160; He didn&#8217;t want to splash too much water or
he might be fined or arrested.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Numb and wary how to proceed with the
hours of the days, he did not know what to do with himself or how
others in his predicament wrestled with their time.&#160; Was he
supposed to meander along with nothing to guide his walking?&#160;
Was he supposed to follow behind those who seemed like herds and
those who seemed like flocks?&#160; If so, he told himself, it
should be with those who were homeless. By following them he could
learn how homeless people survived best and fulfill, at least in a
minuscule way, one&#8217;s innate need for society.&#160; He felt
loose and disconcerted.&#160; His thoughts insurrected him and it
felt as if they were towing away bits of his brain.&#160; The post
office would open in a few hours.&#160; He could make the long
sojourn to his mailbox and see if he had a letter from Noppawan
Piggy but public transportation cost money so he just needed to
comfort himself with the ideas that she had presented to him.&#160;
She often said that everyone from ambassadors to beggars sewed such
petty lives for themselves. At least he thought those were her
exact words. She said something to that effect.&#160; Each time
that he tried to remember exactly what she had written to him, and
what she had spoken from the boat, it became different.&#160; It
was distorted by the impermanent neurological circuitry of the
brain (so little did one possess himself). The world was godless,
love was a selfish realm, and from what he knew of friendship, it
was with people who used each other to grow for a certain time or
share similar attitudes in the hope of not feeling alone when going
through certain stages of life.&#160; He wondered if even his
friendship with Noppawan was evanescent as a whiff of clouds.&#160;
Why should she write to him, he thought to himself.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; If there hadn&#8217;t
been a bit of a thrill in becoming independent and killing off past
associations with family, he told himself, he would commit
suicide.&#160; He couldn&#8217;t really see much point in survival
anyhow with the inevitability of death biting at one&#8217;s
heels.&#160; It was good to kill off past family
associations.&#160; His aunt, he thought, had invited a boy of his
realm into her domain only to find that he had too many needs and
wasn&#8217;t worth the trouble&#8212;the dog that needed to be sent
back to the pet store.&#160; He resented her and was pleased with
his independent stance at severing family from his mind.&#160; He
tried to forget the comfort of sleeping in his cell and never
having to worry about having money for meals and public
toilets.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He slept intermittently on park benches
throughout the day.&#160; To avoid hunger and thirst he took a cup
he found in the trash and begged outside the park.&#160; He watched
a blind old woman with a wooden attach&#233; case of lottery
tickets, a jasmine rosary salesman with merchandise looped around
his arms like long bracelets who went from car to car, a woman at a
table stringing them for her own sales (even the mendicants had to
compete with each other to gain a mere sustenance), sidewalk
seamstresses with their antique foot pumped sewing machines, and a
man with a bicycle-pulled ice-cream cart who stood there scooping
out a dip for someone.&#160;&#160; A sock salesman at his table sat
on a stool with his hand poised under his chin when the rest of his
life was faltering.&#160; They did have such petty lives.&#160;
They, no different than the rich, consumed food and expended their
kinetic energy and liquids in the bedroom in this perennial trap
that human instinct and physiognomy concocted.&#160; He put on his
sunglasses to blind himself from the motion around him and time
became stagnant as a traffic jam he was witnessing&#8212;the people
finally oozing out of trapped busses and around halted vehicles
like leaking oil.&#160; The hours passed somehow and again the park
closed and he slept on its fringes with many others.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The next morning taught him that
breakfast could be waived if begging from the previous evening had
not gotten him the twenty baht required for a meal but he needed to
always keep some coins in his pockets so that he could go into a
public bathroom. Around 2:00 sidewalk restaurant workers tended to
need their own respite from drudgery and a barter arrangement of a
meal for an hour&#8217;s work could sustain him and keep him from
having to buy food. As non-preferable as it was, the police did not
badger one if he washed away his rotting layers of stinking skin in
the polluted canals or the Chao Phraya River so long as he entered
and exited with his underwear on.&#160; The waters did give him a
skin rash, after a few days of bathing in this manner, but this
itch around his thighs was bearable.&#160; Lucrative ventures came
every now and then when men who wanted him.&#160; He, at such
times, was sufficiently numb and insouciant in manhood and he would
go there and serve them safely without letting the whining child
within him clamor out.&#160; He performed, was paid, and left never
combining emotions with such a physical act.&#160; These men would
not be his deliverance.&#160; He had to force that idea into his
head and fight off his wish for a savior.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; .&#160;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Within a month and a little bit of
persistency against refusals, the metropolitan authorities
scheduled him for an interview as a money taker on a city
bus.&#160; He was scheduled with a score of others despite his
age.&#160; He might not have gotten any job at all let alone a
better one than what he was applying for had English not rescued
him.&#160; They needed someone knowledgeable of English in the
information booth in an air-conditioned cubicle at a skytrain
station.&#160; He would not be wearing the grungy blue suits of the
money takers but white ones that looked like a captain. The thought
of it filled him with pride.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; They gave him an advance so that he
could buy this clothing, rent out a cheap room, and not fast when
it came to purchasing his lunches.&#160; They didn&#8217;t give him
a day off but outside of making change for the customers that
needed to be done quickly, the work was easy.&#160; It just
required a familiarity with major landmarks around each of the
stops and that he be able to direct foreigners where they needed to
go.&#160; National holidays (when he got them) were spent in the
vicarious borrowing of a personal life from a movie at a
theatre.&#160; He didn&#8217;t really know his coworkers.&#160;
Since it was his first job, and a new one at that, he kept quiet
and focused on his work.&#160; He looked gauche and foolish and he
worked around them trying not to get into much contact.&#160; They
gossiped about others whom he didn&#8217;t know (perhaps himself as
well) and repeatedly asked how he knew English so well.&#160; Their
tones always became more caustic in addressing him; and when it
came to justifying his knowledge of English he would always vary
his answers fictitiously so as not to feel that he was buried in a
rubble of monotony.&#160;&#160; His introverted awkwardness was at
variance with their complacent self-assured movements, and he
withdrew into a world of shadows surreal as being sucked up into
random scenes of a silent picture show. He was friendless and
alone.&#160; Outside of Noppawan, he couldn&#8217;t even imagine
anyone who really cared about him a little; but he did not have
time to go to his post office box and he feared that she was lost
to him forever.&#160; A solitary person usually needed to invent a
commiserating individual out there even if that person did not
really care; but he did not know anyone with whom to fool himself
with and he saw that despite the Noppawan Doctrine against
pettiness, he was securing a petty life for himself like everyone
else and the exhilaration from his independence was waning.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As
Vanont slipped 40 baht through the hole of the window Jatupon
changed it, attempting to keep his eyes steady in a marginally
sunken poise of professionalism without any special recognition of
the customer wanting the change.&#160; The old man smiled at him
warmly.&#160; &#8220;Where have you been, my boy?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Nawin Biadklang: it was a label, just a
simple and different group of words in which an entire
metamorphosis took place.&#160; He was new and glorious and the
lost and forlorn being that was Jatupon had fallen from him
effortlessly like the stink of scathing skin that he had showered
away in the morning.&#160; Nawin Biadklang stood near the
Hualampong train station, watching the mosaic of light and shadow
at his feet like a child fully in the splendor of the present
moment.&#160; He was drinking milk at a newsstand and thinking
about his recent meeting with Piggy in the Siriaj Hospital
Museum.&#160; He had asked her to go with him to Wonder World
Amusement Park but she wanted the silence away from the meaningless
of action. He turned to the headlines of the Bangkok Post glancing
at the cacophony of human
relations.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He read that a very passive anti-war
demonstration had occurred in Pattaya.&#160; 10,000 Thai Moslems
had prayed for peace.&#160; Well, he thought, it was certainly
gentler than placards and banners outside the American Embassy in
Bangkok, equating Bush as Satan; however it was probably less
effective.&#160; Was the God who allowed thousands of people to be
incinerated in fire and melting steal caring especially about the
fate of the Afghans from a meditation and a chant?&#160; He thought
that it was no wonder people tried to shut out larger issues than
themselves and seek comfort in the personal domain of their petty
lives.&#160; He turned away from the newspaper. Four filthy boys
came to him forcefully.&#160; They wanted milk from his grocery
bag.&#160; They wanted the same as what he was drinking while
reading the horror of the daily news.&#160; He gave part of what he
had but he didn&#8217;t want to give out the rest.&#160; He was
already becoming coarse in his luck and he knew that he was guilty
for providing them with a nominal gratuity and shooing them
away.&#160; He went inside the building, looked for more food and
magazines to take with him on his trip, and then entered the
train.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When the train began to move he went
into a corridor connecting two cars and rinsed his face in the
sink.&#160; He looked into the mirror.&#160; Even his reflection
seemed different.&#160; His eyebrows seemed more bristly and
masculine.&#160; He wasn&#8217;t Jatuporn any longer.&#160; A good
son must join the monastery for a while to fulfill his
mother&#8217;s wish to see her son take on such holy head-shaven
rites.&#160; A good son must fund the livelihood of his middle-aged
parents who wanted to be free from the hardship of work. A good son
must renovate and extend the house of his elderly parents. A
scenario of filial loyalty to serve the parents wishes abounded in
Thais&#8217; simplistic notions of &#8220;good&#8221; behavior but
tragedy had freed him from it.&#160; Then abuse disabused him of
fraternal loyalties.&#160; Now he would be educated and find new
compounds in his sunrises and sunsets.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A train officer asked him to get
his luggage out of the way of the aisle. Jatupon put his suitcase
onto the ceiling rack and sat down watching the scenery go
by&#8212;watching Bangkok zip past him and become the vanishing
point from which something different would emerge from his
experiences at Changmai International School.&#160; He pulled the
post card out of his pocket.&#160; He read the words again and
again, &#8220;I got them to allow me to come to Changmai.&#160;
I&#8217;ll transfer there.&#160; See you in a week.&#8221;&#160; He
smiled, slapped the postcard against his lower lip, and watched the
departure from Bangkok where the scenery became increasingly
green.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When he came home he opened the door
onto plentiful space.&#160; His body became stiff and cold. He
needed to give directives to his legs in order to move. The
movements of his splayed legs when he walked were like parting ice
cycles even though the furnace was operating and it was warm inside
his apartment. Nearly everything movable by two hands was gone, as
well as most that would have required an additional mover.&#160;
Only the heaviest things remained although clavicles of hangers
dangled from the bedroom closet and pots and pans were loyal and
steadfast.&#160; The sofa remained.&#160; It had been difficult to
get in.&#160; It was no wonder that it hadn&#8217;t been
budged.&#160; His socks and underwear had been knocked out of the
dresser before it was taken. He sighed.&#160; His canvases were
gone and from them his new leitmotif that was maturing beyond
Patpong whores in Bangkok to something more thoughtful and
original. True, most of those canvases had been of her so she must
have thought that she was entitled to them as well. She was the
model and more who was seeking justice, he told himself, and
justice was equity.&#160; He hadn&#8217;t paid her so she was
seeking compensation.&#160; All relationships were a contract. All
contracts were based upon the two parties gaining some entitlement
from the agreement. Was there nothing better than this, he asked
himself.&#160; There wasn&#8217;t.&#160; He had thought that he was
helping her, that he was enlightening her, and that he was involved
with her. A tear rolled down his cheek.&#160; She thought that she
was entitled to the canvasses too, he repeatedly thought.&#160; She
thought she was entitled to it all.&#160; Then, for a second, his
attitude changed about the stolen paintings and he was glad that,
at least, she had cared enough to take them. Then he knew that she
would shake sentiment from them no different than tossing out the
contents of his clothing from the dresser. She would sell even
those portraits of herself wherever she could.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He backed against an empty wall and
slid down it squatting like a dog ready to defecate. Then he pulled
into himself in a fetal position.&#160; He was Jatupon in his
puddle of blood yearning for the love of the violator.&#160; If
love was mixing oneself into someone like vodka and cola he loved
her.&#160; If it was a child crying over the loss of his favorite
toy, he was feeling that.&#160; Should a Thai newspaper reporter
get a look at him now, he thought, the nonchalant seducer of the
souls of Patpong girls would seem to him as a fraud.&#160; The
reporter would be disillusioned that this young man championed for
his bit of hedonism had been an illusion.&#160; His head
throbbed.&#160; He needed love from anyone, sex with a stranger,
anything that would stop the pain in his head. With difficulty he
slowly removed his winter coat and gloves with the awkwardness of a
child.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Love, glue, or cocaine&#8212;it was all
the same.&#160; It was all molecules of smell and taste.&#160; It
was a vertiginous freedom and insobriety of action exempt of
logic.&#160; It was the personal adventure in a world of impersonal
actions.&#160; It was admiring certain characteristics that were
lacking in oneself and it sometimes contained some degree of
friendship and caring or wanting to be cared about.&#160; Maybe it
was a vulnerability of a human&#8217;s weaker domain that wanted to
merge with another being to seem to himself as if he were less
petty than what he really was or to record himself permanently in
the thoughts of another being.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It was all gone including those
canvasses on French Quebec mannequins. &#160;His evolution as an
artist had been stunted.&#160; He wanted to cry but beyond that one
tear there was nothing.&#160; All he could do was moan and pick up
the telephone.&#160; He needed a connection.&#160; He needed
Noppawan.&#160; Her sister answered.&#160; &#8220;Nawin,&#8221; she
said nervously,&#160; &#8220;she moved.&#160; She got a different
teaching position.&#160; She wanted a change. She doesn&#8217;t
want to see you&#8212;I&#8217;m not really sure why and I
don&#8217;t think she means it permanently.&#160; Well, I do
understand why. She&#8217;s moving on.&#160; I don&#8217;t think
that she sees it as much of a marriage. Surely you understand that
point. I like you but&#8212;&#8220;&#160; He clicked off the
telephone.&#160; He couldn&#8217;t help himself.&#160; The void was
sucking him into its black hole.&#160; He wanted to lie on his
bed.&#160; He was thankful to still have one.&#160; He wanted Kazem
to materialize and to copulate with him on that bed.&#160; He
remembered then, long ago, having his thoughts in a black hole and
doubting if Kazem&#8217;s love was real, seeing the abstraction of
love in colors and design like cubism, and how hungry he was in
love with Kazem especially when doubting that love.&#160; Nothing
had changed.&#160; He loved Porn and Piggy each in their own way as
desperate as a clinging salamander in the rain.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He called Thai information.&#160; He
asked the operator to search for Suthep, the youngest and the one
closest to his sympathies. At least he used to be. Then he had her
search for Kazem and even Kumpee.&#160;&#160; None of the three had
phone connections in their names.&#160; His aunt, if she were still
living, would be married to someone else.&#160; How would he be
able to find her again in this vast and mutable cosmos?&#160; He
wouldn&#8217;t.&#160; The operator gave him the number of Amorn
Tuwayanonde.&#160; Maybe it was the same one whom he had sometimes
begged and played with as a boy&#8212;maybe the same one who had
grabbed his shoe instead of the ankle causing his dangling body to
fall from the window and into the warehouse triggering off the
burglar alarm.&#160; He dialed the number.&#160; A man
answered.&#160; Nawin did not know what to say so he hung up the
telephone.&#160; The one he really wanted to connect with was his
uncle and he was dead.&#160; And yet they hadn&#8217;t really had a
relationship.&#160; It was strange that the man had paid for all of
his tuition and stay at the international school, all undergraduate
and graduate expenses, and yet had remained a stranger.&#160; He
had been the man&#8217;s son, in a way, and outside a couple times
of staying at his home, during Songkran, he had not known
him.&#160; When he died he did not inherit anything.&#160; He
didn&#8217;t even want or expect anything.&#160; He was grateful
for the educational transformation that had been bestowed unto
him.&#160; What happened to the man&#8217;s money was
anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; If only he could commune with him
somehow to again thank him it would solidify a meaningful
connection in his barren heart.&#160; The cards congratulating him
on his first art exhibition at the art museum at Silpakorn
University and later, the temporary exhibit at the National Gallery
showed that he must have cared about him. He must have been proud
of him.&#160; &#8220;Congratulations on the showing.&#8221;&#160;
That was all they had said.&#160; Nawin guessed that the man had
read about him in the newspapers and knew of the exhibits that way.
It was all strange.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On his knees he scurried through his
socks while discarding his underwear in a pile.&#160; Most of those
socks that she had littered on the floor were folded into each
other as mates, but not all.&#160; He felt inside each sock and
when he couldn&#8217;t find anything he would throw it into that
pile like a dead fish.&#160; Within the toes of one pair he pulled
out four plastic bags of cocaine.&#160; It was his stash for
periods of loss and he monitored what he took according to the
dictates of his third of a teaspoon rule for self-rations.&#160;
The Nawin rule stated that once every three months if an emergency
arose requiring exhilaration or thrust away from the void, then he
might administer the prescription.&#160; Such was his doctoral
degree of addiction and from this philosophical islet inundations
from void and addiction could not take him away.&#160; He sat on
the unmovable sofa and snorted the cocaine from one of its wooden
armrests.&#160; He could feel it like a Thai massage over his
entire body and the insouciance it brought to his
thoughts.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; He put on his winter coat and gloves and got
in a taxi.&#160; He told the taxi driver to take him to a go-go bar
called &#8220;Foxy&#8217;s.&#8221;&#160; He had been there several
times before.&#160; He watched women twisting their bodies around
poles as if each movement of being a woman was centered on waxing
the shiny phallus.&#160; Tissue paper probably enlarged their
bosoms but he didn&#8217;t care.&#160; He would eat the juicy fruit
and its wrappings no different than any nigger his melon.&#160; He
wanted to relieve himself in one or more of them.&#160; Lost, he
wanted to be lead by the hallucinations of his mind.&#160; When one
who was on break said her hellos and sat down on his lap, he put
his paws on all parts of her body.&#160; She told him that he was a
&#8220;naughty boy&#8221; and asked him where he was from. He told
her.&#160; She said that she liked Asian men since they were so
small.&#160; He told her that he wasn&#8217;t small.&#160;
&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen them before.&#160; They are itsy bitsy
small.&#8221; She used her fingers as a measurement.&#160; It
wasn&#8217;t what he cared to hear and although he wanted to pierce
her with his lengthy sword, he left in disgust.&#160; He walked
further down the street to a male go-go bar that he had never been
in before although his wistful eyes had scanned it numerous times
in the past month.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When he entered young men from their
angles of the platform were pulling on their genitalia within dark
frothy briefs of an opaque translucency that made the movements of
their genitalia obvious.&#160; He watched and waited not
understanding why it was erotic.&#160; He watched and waited for
the midnight all-legal fuck show.&#160; He was tempted to take
these sly masturbators by force until what little was rational in
his brain contrived a belief that he was shackled against the wall
waiting to be attacked by them.&#160; That portion of the brain
said to him, &#8220;Even if you were to get out of your&#160;
shackles and fetters it would be bad manners to attack these men
before they come to attack you.&#8221;&#160; He watched their
contortionist- twisting and the surreal images on the stage became
more like flames and smoke.&#160; The why&#8212;the reason that the
movements were erotic--eluded him.&#160; The why&#8212;the
reason&#8212;that flames and smoke plumes made these adonises
erotic in a spinning room of gnarling metallic walls was a
mystery.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He wasn&#8217;t sure if it was a
dismembered part of a woman, a transvestite, or something amorphous
and alien, but lips in the sky spoke to him.&#160; &#8220;Do you
want to take one home, honey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I want all of them,&#8221; he
said.&#160; She laughed.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Do you have that much
money?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Maybe for one,&#8221; he
said.&#160; &#8220;I need one to fuck me and my girlfriend
throughout the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;That will be double the price,
but well worth it.&#160; We&#8217;ll see to that.&#160;
Satisfaction guaranteed. What&#8217;s your girlfriend&#8217;s name,
honey?&#8221; asked the lips.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Foxys,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Foxy&#8217;s, like the girl
go-go bar across the street?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know her
name,&#8221; he told the lips.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You don&#8217;t know your
girlfriend&#8217;s name?&#8221; guffawed the lips.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I never checked the birth
certificate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Never checked the birth
certificate! What a crazy mother fucker you are!&#8221;&#160; The
lips laughed hysterically.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Do you have paint and
canvases?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Do I have what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160; &#8220;I need paint.&#160; I&#8217;ll paint the
fuck show on the walls.&#160; I&#8217;m a famous artist in
Thailand.&#160; Don&#8217;t you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;No, is that so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I have to draw when the fuck show
begins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The lips laughed hysterically.&#160;
She coughed from choking on her own saliva.&#160; &#8220;Wanting to
pay in paint?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Wanting to paint a fuck
show,&#8221; he said. He looked through her mouth. He could see
down her throat into her entrails.&#160; Her brain was where her
stomach should have been.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Where to?&#8221; asked the taxi
driver.&#160; The voice again seemed like one he could vaguely
recall.&#160; A boy who had been on top in the fuck show (a boy 18
or 19 who was a snowman with a bit of a French complexion) was
seated next to him.&#160; He remembered paying top Canadian dollars
for this boy.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Just keep going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;You said that 15 minutes ago but
I need a destination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Foxy&#8217;s&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;We passed that long ago.
It was right across the street from where you were at,&#8221; said
the taxi driver through his gray balding scalp.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;Okay, just take us out of the
city.&#160; Someplace rural.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m now turning on a
highway going north.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Do you still want me with your
girlfriend?&#8221; asked the boy.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I was going to pair you up with
a girl: voyeurism.&#160; I&#8217;ve had second
thoughts.&#8221;&#160; He kissed the boy on his lips.&#160; He
wanted to drain him of all liquids including his breath.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The boy pulled back his face to
come up for breath.&#160; &#8220;Where are we going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,
really.&#160; Maybe we should go to a hotel.&#160; I guess we
can&#8217;t do it in the backseat here, off of a road
somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yeah, the back seat of a taxi
thing wouldn&#8217;t be too comfortable for anyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yeah, okay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;There&#8217;s a sign pointing
out a Best Western,&#8221; he told Nawin.&#160; &#8220;Can you take
us to that hotel?&#8221; the boy asked the taxi driver.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Excuse me.&#160; Is that the
decision?&#160; Best Western?&#8221; asked the taxi driver.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Nawin.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Turning to Nawin he
interjected, &#8220;You aren&#8217;t a psycho, cannibal, or
anything, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m a vegetarian,&#8221;
said Nawin.&#160; He chuckled.&#160; &#8220;Don&#8217;t
worry.&#160; I won&#8217;t cut you up into pieces.&#160; I&#8217;m
harmless, and I hope the same is true of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Sure, most of the time,&#8221;
said the boy as he yawned.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Jatupon, don&#8217;t be
shocked!&#160; Look at me in the rear view mirror.&#160; Face your
fears,&#8221; said the taxi driver.&#160; Jatupon looked up.&#160;
He was startled but he wasn&#8217;t horrified.&#160; He saw that
the mosquito was in the old man&#8217;s form.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I made a merger,&#8221; said the
mosquito.&#160; &#8220;I bought out the stock of his blood.&#160;
With controlling stock I am the head of the company.&#160; I
control all movements.&#8221;&#160; He laughed.&#160; &#8220;How do
I look?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nawin did not know what to say.&#160; &#8220;My God, I
haven&#8217;t seen you in 12 years, my boy.&#160; You&#8217;ve
grown up.&#160; You have money and nice clothes. Who&#8217;d ever
think we&#8217;d meet again and in Montreal of all
places.&#8221;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Nawin laughed bitterly&#160;
&#8220;Don&#8217;t use that word, Jatupon, with me. Okay?&#160; I
hate that word. You didn&#8217;t need to emerge.&#160; My lessens
about life are all my own, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Can you face life without
clinging to anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;It is the way of the
Buddha&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;But is it your way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Sure, why not?&#160; If I choose
so I can do anything.&#160; If I choose, I can swat you out of
existence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;The only friend you&#8217;ve ever
had?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Sure, why not?&#160; Just like
with a gnat.&#8221; He slapped him onto the head and the mosquito
seemed to shrink.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Please don&#8217;t.&#160; Who
will drive you then if you get rid of me? You killed my ancestors
in your buckets of laundry soap and slapped them into your palms
like a sport. I think that is enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I can get into another cab if I
choose. I can stop the coke if I choose.&#160; I don&#8217;t need
women or anybody least of all you.&#160; But you know, you
aren&#8217;t so bad.&#160; You certainly aren&#8217;t scary any
longer.&#160; Maybe I&#8217;ll let you stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Gee, thanks.&#8221;&#160; The
mosquito paused for a moment.&#160; &#8220;Why do you have this
go-go boy in here?&#160; Who is this boy? &#8220; he asked.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Someone I&#8217;m ready to
fuck&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I gathered that; and that the
tenor of the conversation had turned against back seat liaisons.
I&#8217;m just puzzled by these changeable sexual patterns,
Jatupon.&#160; Something&#8217;s not right in your head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Listen!&#160; Don&#8217;t use
that name with me or I&#8217;ll take you by the fucking neck and
smash your face against the windshield&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Okay, Nawin, calm
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;For that matter, I could roll
down the window and let you fly out and drive myself.&#160; I have
an international driver&#8217;s license.&#160; Nawin is a big boy,
now, Mosquito.&#8221;&#160; He guffawed at the pest and slapped him
on the head.&#160;&#160; The mosquito/man hissed and stuck out its
fangs. &#160;&#8220;You watch yourself.&#160; You are in forces
over your head.&#160; You&#8217;re not even in control of
yourself.&#160; Why did you get married?&#160; Why did you bring
Porn here?&#160; Why am I and this boy with you now?&#160; What
forces drive you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Hunger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Porn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Hunger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Noppawan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Union.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Hunger again.&#160; Hunger for
stability.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Okay, hunger again.&#160; Women
are a turn on&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Are they?&#160; And here you are
with a boy, Jatupon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;The name&#8217;s Nawin, &#8220;
he shouted.&#160; Then he calmed down and laughed at himself.&#160;
&#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s Jatupon; and you&#8217;re right, here I am
with a boy.&#8221;&#160; He laughed again.&#160; &#8220;Variety is
the spice of life. That is an American aphorism, Mosquito; and
Nawin here is a full blooded American born in the
states.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t see a Best
Western.&#160; How far out on this road do you want to
go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Nawin looked at the boy next to him who
had fallen asleep.&#160; &#8220;He looks like a child&#8212;a hurt
child trying in sleep to just figure out how to make sense out of
his situation, survive and not sell himself out too fully.&#160; I
should be saving kids like this&#8212;even in Canada kids can be
trashed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Will you save him before or
after you fuck him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Maybe I ought to just go
home.&#160; This guy on top or bottom isn&#8217;t going to stop me
from hurting or from being hungry. It just propels me quicker to
the next hunger.&#8221;&#160; He smiled.&#160; &#8220;I think I can
get a grip on me completely.&#160; I really do.&#160; Having people
plug up my hurts just causes them from healing properly.&#160; I
don&#8217;t want to be a wrinkled black thing like you and still
picking up prostitutes.&#160; Piggy had the right idea.&#160; I
might as well start the habit sooner than later.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;She&#8217;s left
you.&#160; She&#8217;s gone now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s okay. Maybe she
needs some time to grow away from being a Biadklang.&#160; Maybe
she needs to get rid of my name completely.&#160; I can be
alone.&#160; I need a relationship with myself anyhow.&#160; Maybe
I&#8217;ll see her again and maybe not.&#160; Anyhow, there&#8217;s
some Aristotle and Plato I want to read&#8212;a textbook on
tenebrism I need to get through for my Caravaggio class. I&#8217;ll
have to begin my doctoral thesis shortly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Hollow ideas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;To the impetuousness of human
feelings, hollow; but not to the mind. There the theory of forms is
sensed as eternal.&#160; Take me home.&#160; Drop this kid off
wherever he wants first.&#8221;</p>

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK, CORPUS OF A SIAM MOSQUITO ***

*******This file should be named siamm10h.htm or siamm10h.zip *******

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, siamm11h.zip

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new eBook
files per month, or 500 more eBooks in 2000 for a total of 4000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion eBook
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 eBooks.  We need
funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain
or increase our production and reach our goals.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,
Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones
that have responded.

As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
PMB 113
1739 University Ave.
Oxford, MS 38655-4109

Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment
method other than by check or money order.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by
the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.

We need your donations more than ever!
